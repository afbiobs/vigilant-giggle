She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak\nand immediately her bleeding stopped. \"Who touched me?\" Jesus asked.\nWhen they all denied it, Peter said, \"Master, the people are crowding\nand pressing against you.\" But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me; I know\nthat power has gone out from me.\" Then the woman, seeing that she could\nnot go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence\nof all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been\ninstantly healed. Then he said to her \"Daughter, your faith has healed\nyou, Go in peace.",
