  "scripture_text": "As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman\nwas there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one\ncould heal her. She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak\nand immediately her bleeding stopped. \"Who touched me?\" Jesus asked.\nWhen they all denied it, Peter said, \"Master the people are crowding and\npressing against you.\" But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me; I know that\npower has gone out from me.\" Then the woman, seeing that she could not\ngo unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of\nall the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been\ninstantly healed. Then he said to her \"Daughter, your faith has healed\nyou. Go in peace.",
  "devotional": "Let me put the story in context.\n\nJairus, a prominent member of the community and the ruler of the\nSynagogue, had one daughter who was 12 years old and was dying. He came\nbefore Jesus, fell at his feet pleading that Jesus would come and heal\nher. Jesus went with him along with a crowd who surrounded Jesus. The\nidea behind the Greek word for surround is to crush or press against. It\ncomes from the Greek word for choke/strangle, so this a very intense\nmoment. Jairus and the crowd are making their way to his home. Lots of\npeople are pressing against Jesus, invading his personal space. Suddenly\nthis woman touches the fringe of Jesus' robe, and everything stops.\nBefore we pick up the story let's take a look at this woman.\n\n1. We know that she had an 'issue of blood' for 12 years. We can only\nspeculate as to the reason why she was bleeding. This most likely refers\nto a chronic vaginal or uterine haemorrhage. We also know from Mark's\naccount that 'She had suffered a great deal from many doctors and over\nthe years she had spent everything she had to pay them, but she had got\nno better. In fact, she had gotten worse.' Mark 5:26. These doctors\nwould have given her 'Contemporary remedies which included wine mixed\nwith rubber, alum, and crocuses.' (D. Bock, Luke \\[BECNT\\], 1:793).We\nalso know that because of her condition she would have been constantly\nliving with acute shame, as she would have been viewed as unclean.\n\na. The Levitical law stated that during a women's menstrual period she\nwas not permitted to go to the place of worship. See Leviticus 15:19-28.\nThe law in Leviticus was very straight forward setting out what was\nrequired. It is not easy to understand why God gave this law. However,\nby the time of Jesus, the Rabbi's had introduced a whole new set of\nlaws that would make life impossible for any woman with this chronic\ncondition.\n\nb. If a new mother haemorrhaged for more than seven days after giving\nbirth she was put into isolation. If the haemorrhaging continued for a\nfurther seven days, her baby was taken from her. A nurse chosen by the\npriest would look after the baby until the mother was pronounced\nclean.\n\nc. If the haemorrhaging continued for more than 14 days, she was put\ninto isolation for 40 days, if the problem continued after that she was\nisolated 120 days. If the problem continued, she was put into permanent\nisolation reporting to the priest once a year.\n\nThis poor woman had been bleeding for 12 years, so she would've been\nconsidered cursed by God and unworthy of healing. At this point she was\nofficially pronounced dead. Her name would have been removed from the\nrolls of the living.\n\nd. This meant that she would have had to beg for food, and anyone she\ntouched would have been declared unclean for 21 days. If she touched a\nreligious leader, she could have been flogged on the spot \\[Roman\nauthorities permitting.\\] Or she would have been banished to live at\nGehenna, a rubbish dump outside Jerusalem. The rabbi's taught, that if a\nreligious leader did not punish a woman who touched him while she was\nhaemorrhaging, he would inherit her curse.\n\ne. Because she was considered dead, this meant that she would have\nbeen disowned and despised by all of society. This dear lady was living\na terrible life. She was the 'walking dead.'",
