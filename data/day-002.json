  "devotional": "<p><b>Let me put the story in context.</b></p>\n<p><b>Jairus, a prominent member of the community and the ruler of the Synagogue, had one daughter who was 12 years old and was dying. He came before Jesus, fell at his feet pleading that Jesus would come and heal her. Jesus went with him along with a crowd who surrounded Jesus. The idea behind the Greek word for surround is to crush or press against. It comes from the Greek word for choke/strangle, so this a very intense moment. Jairus and the crowd are making their way to his home. Lots of people are pressing against Jesus, invading his personal space. Suddenly this woman touches the fringe of Jesus’ robe, and everything stops. Before we pick up the story let’s take a look at this woman.</b></p>\n<p><b>1. We know that she had an ‘issue of blood’ for 12 years. We can only speculate as to the reason why she was bleeding.  This most likely refers to a chronic vaginal or uterine haemorrhage. We also know from Mark’s account that ‘She had suffered a great deal from many doctors and over the years she had spent everything she had to pay them, but she had got no better. In fact, she had gotten worse.’ Mark 5:26. These doctors would have given her ‘Contemporary remedies which included wine mixed with rubber, alum, and crocuses.’ (D. Bock, Luke [BECNT], 1:793).We also know that because of her condition she would have been constantly living with acute shame, as she would have been viewed as unclean.</b></p>\n<p><b>a. The Levitical law stated that during a women’s menstrual period she was not permitted to go to the place of worship. See Leviticus 15:19-28. The law in Leviticus was very straight forward setting out what was required. It is not easy to understand why God gave this law. However, by the time of Jesus, the Rabbi&#x27;s had introduced a whole new set of laws that would make life impossible for any woman with this chronic condition.</b></p>\n<p><b> b. If a new mother haemorrhaged for more than seven days after giving birth she was put into isolation. If the haemorrhaging continued for a further seven days, her baby was taken from her. A nurse chosen by the priest would look after the baby until the mother was pronounced clean.</b></p>\n<p><b>c. If the haemorrhaging continued for more than 14 days, she was put into isolation for 40 days, if the problem continued after that she was isolated 120 days. If the problem continued, she was put into permanent isolation reporting to the priest once a year. </b></p>\n<p><b>This poor woman had been bleeding for 12 years, so she would’ve been considered cursed by God and unworthy of healing. At this point she was officially pronounced dead. Her name would have been removed from the rolls of the living.</b></p>\n<p><b>d. This meant that she would have had to beg for food, and anyone she touched would have been declared unclean for 21 days. If she touched a religious leader, she could have been flogged on the spot [Roman authorities permitting.] Or she would have been banished to live at Gehenna, a rubbish dump outside Jerusalem. The rabbi’s taught, that if a religious leader did not punish a woman who touched him while she was haemorrhaging, he would inherit her curse.</b></p>\n<p><b>e. Because she was considered dead, this meant that she would have been disowned and despised by all of society. This dear lady was living a terrible life. She was the ‘walking dead.’</b></p>",
