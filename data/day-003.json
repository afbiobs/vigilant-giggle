  "devotional": "<p><b>It was into this broken, lonely life shrouded in shame, that the power of Jesus brought about glorious transformation. It’s important to notice that the power of Jesus healed her physical problem, it took away her haemorrhaging, but it did not take away her shame. The instant she was physically healed she was still perceived by others as the same haemorrhaging women. Jesus could have just walked on and said nothing, and the woman could have gone away ‘healed,’ but this dear lady needed a much deeper work done in her life than just physical healing. She needed a work done in her life that could only happen with an honest encounter with Jesus.</b></p>\n<p><b>Let’s look at how Jesus dealt with this woman.</b></p>\n<p><b>1. Jesus stopped.</b></p>\n<p><b>As he was on his way to heal the dying daughter of a prominent member of society, Jairus, a somebody, Jesus stopped. Mark tells us that ‘he turned around in the crowd.’ Then he goes on to say, ‘He kept on looking around him.’ Mark 5:30,32. Jesus was intent on engaging with this lady. He wanted to give her something nobody had given her, time.</b></p>\n<p><b>This amazes me. At this critical point, a time when another desperately needy person was asking Jesus for help, Jesus made space and opportunity for someone who was not even on the social ladder, never mind being at the bottom of the social ladder.</b></p>\n<p><b>The shame this lady carried, drove her into isolation and acute loneliness and she needed to know that she was valued.</b></p>\n<p><b>2. Jesus gave her back her voice.</b></p>\n<p><b>Luke tells us, ‘The whole crowd heard her explain...’ then Luke says ‘While he was still speaking to her…’ we have no idea how long this conversation went on for, but it was ended with the news of the death of Jairus’ daughter.  </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus was ‘present,’ so he was able to listen to this lady’s story.</b></p>\n<p><b>When the crowd saw Jesus looking around him, they understood that his focus was being redirected and his attention was now on her. Jesus’ actions were saying ‘You are too precious and important to be defined by a chronic illness. You matter and your story is important.</b></p>\n<p><b>I love the fact that Jesus did not take her aside so she could tell him about her story and healing. Others needed to hear it also, so they were able to see her in a new light and not define her by her past.</b></p>\n<p><b>3. Jesus redefined her identity.</b></p>\n<p><b>‘Daughter’</b><b> he said, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘your faith has made you well,’</span></b><b> Being healed from her haemorrhaging would not be sufficient to remove her shame, she needed to realise who she was.
