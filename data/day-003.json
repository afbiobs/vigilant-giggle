She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak and immediately her bleeding stopped. “Who touched me?” Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.” But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.” Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said to her “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”\n\nIt was into this broken, lonely life shrouded in shame, that the power of Jesus brought about glorious transformation. It’s important to notice that the power of Jesus healed her physical problem, it took away her haemorrhaging, but it did not take away her shame. The instant she was physically healed she was still perceived by others as the same haemorrhaging women. Jesus could have just walked on and said nothing, and the woman could have gone away ‘healed,’ but this dear lady needed a much deeper work done in her life than just physical healing. She needed a work done in her life that could only happen with an honest encounter with Jesus.\n\nLet’s look at how Jesus dealt with this woman.\n\n1. Jesus stopped.\n\nAs he was on his way to heal the dying daughter of a prominent member of society, Jairus, a somebody, Jesus stopped. Mark tells us that ‘he turned around in the crowd.’ Then he goes on to say, ‘He kept on looking around him.’ Mark 5:30,32. Jesus was intent on engaging with this lady. He wanted to give her something nobody had given her, time.\n\nThis amazes me. At this critical point, a time when another desperately needy person was asking Jesus for help, Jesus made space and opportunity for someone who was not even on the social ladder, never mind being at the bottom of the social ladder.\n\nThe shame this lady carried, drove her into isolation and acute loneliness and she needed to know that she was valued.\n\n2. Jesus gave her back her voice.\n\nLuke tells us, ‘The whole crowd heard her explain...’ then Luke says ‘While he was still speaking to her…’ we have no idea how long this conversation went on for, but it was ended with the news of the death of Jairus’ daughter.\n\nJesus was ‘present,’ so he was able to listen to this lady’s story.\n\nWhen the crowd saw Jesus looking around him, they understood that his focus was being redirected and his attention was now on her. Jesus’ actions were saying ‘You are too precious and important to be defined by a chronic illness. You matter and your story is important.\n\nI love the fact that Jesus did not take her aside so she could tell him about her story and healing. Others needed to hear it also, so they were able to see her in a new light and not define her by her past.\n\n3. Jesus redefined her identity.\n\n‘Daughter’ he said, ‘your faith has made you well,’ Being healed from her haemorrhaging would not be sufficient to remove her shame, she needed to realise who she was. This lady is the only individual that Jesus calls ‘daughter.’ The word for daughter is “thygatēr’’ and it means: “a daughter of God, acceptable to God, rejoicing in God’s peculiar care and protection. In calling her ‘Daughter,’ Jesus was changing her status in society. Prior to her encounter with Jesus, she was a nobody, an outcast. Jesus restored her to her rightful position, she was acceptable, a lady of dignity, a daughter of God.",
