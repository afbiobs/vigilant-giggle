  "scripture_text": "As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman\nwas there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one\ncould heal her. She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak\nand immediately her bleeding stopped. \"Who touched me?\" Jesus asked.\nWhen they all denied it, Peter said, \"Master, the people are crowding\nand pressing against you.\" But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me; I know\nthat power has gone out from me.\" Then the woman, seeing that she could\nnot go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence\nof all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been\ninstantly healed. Then he said to her \"Daughter, your faith has healed\nyou. Go in peace.",
  "devotional": "It was into this broken, lonely life shrouded in shame, that the power\nof Jesus brought about glorious transformation. It's important to notice\nthat the power of Jesus healed her physical problem, it took away her\nhaemorrhaging, but it did not take away her shame. The instant she was\nphysically healed she was still perceived by others as the same\nhaemorrhaging women. Jesus could have just walked on and said nothing,\nand the woman could have gone away 'healed,' but this dear lady needed a\nmuch deeper work done in her life than just physical healing. She needed\na work done in her life that could only happen with an honest encounter\nwith Jesus.\n\nLet's look at how Jesus dealt with this woman.\n\n1. Jesus stopped.\n\nAs he was on his way to heal the dying daughter of a prominent member\nof society, Jairus, a somebody, Jesus stopped. Mark tells us that 'he\nturned around in the crowd.' Then he goes on to say, 'He kept on looking\naround him.' Mark 5:30,32. Jesus was intent on engaging with this lady.\nHe wanted to give her something nobody had given her, time.\n\nThis amazes me. At this critical point, a time when another\ndesperately needy person was asking Jesus for help, Jesus made space and\nopportunity for someone who was not even on the social ladder, never\nmind being at the bottom of the social ladder.\n\nThe shame this lady carried, drove her into isolation and acute\nloneliness and she needed to know that she was valued.\n\n2. Jesus gave her back her voice.\n\nLuke tells us, 'The whole crowd heard her explain\\...' then Luke says\n'While he was still speaking to her...' we have no idea how long this\nconversation went on for, but it was ended with the news of the death of\nJairus' daughter.\n\nJesus was 'present,' so he was able to listen to this lady's story.\n\nWhen the crowd saw Jesus looking around him, they understood that his\nfocus was being redirected and his attention was now on her. Jesus'\nactions were saying 'You are too precious and important to be defined by\na chronic illness. You matter and your story is important.\n\nI love the fact that Jesus did not take her aside so she could tell\nhim about her story and healing. Others needed to hear it also, so they\nwere able to see her in a new light and not define her by her past.\n\n3. Jesus redefined her identity.\n\n**'Daughter' he said, 'your faith has made you well,' Being healed from\nher haemorrhaging would not be sufficient to remove her shame, she\nneeded to realise who she was. This lady is the only individual that\nJesus calls 'daughter.' The word for daughter is \"thygatēr'' and it\nmeans: \"a daughter of God, acceptable to God*,* rejoicing in God's\npeculiar care and protection. In calling her 'Daughter,' Jesus was\nchanging her status in society. Prior to her encounter with Jesus, she\nwas a nobody, an outcast. Jesus restored her to her rightful position,\nshe was acceptable, a lady of dignity, a daughter of God.**",
