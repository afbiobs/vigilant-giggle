  "devotional": "“Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”\n\nI would like us to consider one of the best-known stories in the bible. The story of how Peter and Jesus walked on the water.\n\nFor many, this well-known story has come to mean something like this. ‘Peter had the right idea, getting out of the boat and quite literally stepping out in faith. Indeed, in all our lives we can see Jesus standing out on the stormy waters of life bidding us to “come unto him.” Like Peter we need this invitation, find the courage of faith needed to swing our legs over the boat’s side and then step out onto the waters. If we do, then we too will walk with Jesus, trusting him alone to help us do great things for God. But beware of doubts and fears! Don’t pay any attention to the winds that howl or the waves that lap against your shins. Keep your eyes fixed on the Master, for if you do, then in his loving confident gaze you will find the strength and courage you need to stay upright. Peter failed to have enough faith, he sank, but you can do better!’\n\nQuestion: Is this a legitimate and helpful application of this story? Are we being encouraged to be like Peter, to step out of the security of our boats and join Jesus on the stormy waters?\n\nCould it be that this way of applying this story is very dangerous for a number of reasons? [If you would like to know how I think this story could be applied to our lives keep reading over the next few days.]\n\nThe dangers of this popular application.\n\na. It could produce an ego-centric life and ministry.\n\nTo be like Peter, to walk on water, to do great things for God, sounds wonderful. However, often the way this story is taught and applied, all it does is appeals to our ego. We all want a theology that strokes our ego.\n\nWe think, if I could walk on water. If I could show the world how wonderful and special I am. If God were to really use me in obvious and significant ways then I would feel a lot better about myself. My ego always wants to walk on water.\n\nb. It could produce a performance based mindset.\n\nTo apply the story of Peter walking on water as an example of courageous faith, is to make ourselves the centre of our story. We become the focus, and the life of faith, or any ministry we may have becomes about meeting our needs, not the needs of others.\n\nAn ego-centric philosophy of life or ministry is not consistent with how Jesus viewed life or ministry. Jesus often told people, ‘don’t tell anyone about this.’ for example See Mark 1:44. 7:36.\n\nWhen we look at the life and ministry of Jesus you will notice that for Jesus the healing of the individual was more important than his reputation. His ministry was never ego-centric.",
