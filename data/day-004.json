  "scripture_text": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on\nahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he\nhad dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.\nLater that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a\nconsiderable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind\nwas against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on\nthe lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were\nterrified. \"It's a ghost,\"they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus\nimmediately said to them: \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\"\n\"Lord, if it's you,\" Peter replied, \"tell me to come to you on the\nwater.\" \"Come,\" he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked\non the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was\nafraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \"Lord, save me!\"\nImmediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \"You of little\nfaith,\" he said, \"why did you doubt?\" And when they climbed into the\nboat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped\nhim, saying, \"Truly you are the Son of God.",
  "devotional": "I would like us to consider one of the best-known stories in the\nbible. The story of how Peter and Jesus walked on the water.\n\nFor many, this well-known story has come to mean something like this.\n'Peter had the right idea, getting out of the boat and quite literally\nstepping out in faith. Indeed, in all our lives we can see Jesus\nstanding out on the stormy waters of life bidding us to \"come unto him.\"\nLike Peter we need this invitation, find the courage of faith needed to\nswing our legs over the boat's side and then step out onto the waters.\nIf we do, then we too will walk with Jesus, trusting him alone to help\nus do great things for God. But beware of doubts and fears! Don't pay\nany attention to the winds that howl or the waves that lap against your\nshins. Keep your eyes fixed on the Master, for if you do, then in his\nloving confident gaze you will find the strength and courage you need to\nstay upright. Peter failed to have enough faith, he sank, but you can do\nbetter!'\n\nQuestion: Is this a legitimate and helpful application of this story?\nAre we being encouraged to be like Peter, to step out of the security of\nour boats and join Jesus on the stormy waters?\n\nCould it be that this way of applying this story is very dangerous for\na number of reasons? \\[If you would like to know how I think this story\ncould be applied to our lives keep reading over the next few days.\\]\n\nThe dangers of this popular application.\n\na. It could produce an ego-centric life and ministry.\n\nTo be like Peter, to walk on water, to do great things for God, sounds\nwonderful. However, often the way this story is taught and applied, all\nit does is appeals to our ego. We all want a theology that strokes our\nego.\n\nWe think, if I could walk on water. If I could show the world how\nwonderful and special I am. If God were to really use me in obvious and\nsignificant ways then I would feel a lot better about myself.

It could produce a performance based mindset.\n\nTo apply the story of Peter walking on water as an example of\ncourageous faith, is to make ourselves the centre of our story. We\nbecome the focus, and the life of faith, or any ministry we may have\nbecomes about meeting our needs, not the needs of others.\n\nAn ego-centric philosophy of life or ministry is not consistent with\nhow Jesus viewed life or ministry. Jesus often told people, 'don't tell\nanyone about this.' for example See Mark 1:44. 7:36.\n\nWhen we look at the life and ministry of Jesus you will notice that\nfor Jesus the healing of the individual was more important than his\nreputation. His ministry was never ego-centric.",
