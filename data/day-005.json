After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”\n\nWanting to walk on water is rooted in a need to impress. It is expressing a desire to be seen. It is living out of a belief that, what I can do is more important than who I am. Any desire we have to walk on water, to be impressive is to value achievement above character.\n\nThere is a common misconception that God’s will for our lives is primarily about us. Look at what Peter says. “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” this is a very emphatic, exclusive statement, ‘tell me!’ We are inclined to over individualise God’s will. When we are seeking to know and do the will of God we should always be concerned for the needs and blessing of others. Knowing and doing the will of God should be an expression of our love for God and for others. The will of God for our lives will always challenge and undermine our ego and potential for seflish living.\n\nIt is important to note that through Peter’s attempt to walk on water, at that time Peter appears not to be thinking about anyone else.\n\nWhat may have been going on in Peter’s heart?\n\nIt may be that Peter’s decision to step out of the boat was motivated by internal conflict and turmoil. Was his choice to step out of the boat his way of trying to manage his insecurities and fears? In this boat, in the middle of a storm, this familiar place was the last place Peter wanted to be.’ A place where he felt filled with uncertainty, fear and confusion. This did not feel like the will of God, but it was!",
