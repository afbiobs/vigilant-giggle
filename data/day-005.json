After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.

Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.</b><b>  When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”</span></b><b>  “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.”</b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> “Come,”</span></b><b> he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.  But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“You of little faith,”</span></b><b> he said, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“why did you doubt?”</span></b><b>  And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.
