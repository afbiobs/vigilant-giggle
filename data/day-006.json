  "scripture_text": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on\nahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he\nhad dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.\nLater that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a\nconsiderable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind\nwas against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on\nthe lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were\nterrified. \"It's a ghost,\"they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus\nimmediately said to them: \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\"\n\"Lord, if it's you,\" Peter replied, \"tell me to come to you on the\nwater.\" \"Come,\" he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked\non the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was\nafraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \"Lord, save me!\" Immediately\nJesus reached out his hand and caught him. \"You of little faith,\" he\nsaid, \"why did you doubt?\" And when they climbed into the boat, the\nwind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying,\n\"Truly you are the Son of God.",
  "devotional": "Peters request to Jesus was an expression of doubt not faith.\n\n\"Lord if it is You, tell me to come to you on the water.''\n\n\\[a\\] The very word 'if' smacks of doubt, of needing to test something\nout. There are only a couple of other times in Matthew when someone\naddresses Jesus through the word 'if.' It happens three times in Matthew\n4 when in the wilderness the devil repeatedly says to Jesus, 'If you are\nthe Son of God.'? And in Matthew 27:40, 'Come down from the cross, if\nyou are the Son of God.\"?\n\n\\[b\\] The particular Greek word for doubt Matthew uses in verse 31\n'distazo' occurs only twice in the whole bible, here and Matthew 28:17.\nIt means 'to stand in two ways.' (dis, \"double,\" stasis, \"a standing\")\nimplying uncertainty as which way to take. The kind of doubt that\nMatthew refers to in this chapter is not a doubt that comes from fear.\nRather this is more a rational or logical doubt that says. \"Is Jesus who\nhe says he is? Is he what he appears to be?\n\nSo before Peter got out of the boat there was a lot going on in his\nmind.\n\n\\[c\\] Nowhere in this passage does Jesus commend Peter for his faith.\nWhen people suggest that Peter's stepping out of the boat was a step of\nfaith, what do they base this claim on?
