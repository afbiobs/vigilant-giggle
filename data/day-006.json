After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”\n\nPeters request to Jesus was an expression of doubt not faith.\n\n“Lord if it is You, tell me to come to you on the water.’’\n\n[a] The very word ‘if’ smacks of doubt, of needing to test something out. There are only a couple of other times in Matthew when someone addresses Jesus through the word ‘if.’ It happens three times in Matthew 4 when in the wilderness the devil repeatedly says to Jesus, ‘If you are the Son of God.’? And in Matthew 27:40, ‘Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God.”?\n\n[b] The particular Greek word for doubt Matthew uses in verse 31 ‘distazo’ occurs only twice in the whole bible, here and Matthew 28:17. It means ‘to stand in two ways.’ (dis, “double,” stasis, “a standing”) implying uncertainty as which way to take. The kind of doubt that Matthew refers to in this chapter is not a doubt that comes from fear. Rather this is more a rational or logical doubt that says. “Is Jesus who he says he is? Is he what he appears to be?\n\nSo before Peter got out of the boat there was a lot going on in his mind.\n\n[c] Nowhere in this passage does Jesus commend Peter for his faith. When people suggest that Peter’s stepping out of the boat was a step of faith, what do they base this claim on? Believing that Peter stepping out of the boat was an act of faith, actually trivialises faith, it turns faith into some magical power that is not related to our everyday living.\n\n[d] His doubt was not the reason why he sank. Matthew says, “When he saw the wind, he was afraid and beginning to sink.” Fear made him sink not doubt.\n\nPeter’s request was a wrong response to a divine revelation.\n\nThe NIV reads “But Jesus immediately said to them. ‘Take courage it is I don’t be afraid.” The original Greek does not say ‘It is I’, but ‘I AM”\n\nHere and elsewhere in the gospels, this simple designation powerfully connects Jesus to the God of Israel. When Moses asks God at the burning bush for his name, God says that his name is ‘I AM’ Yahweh is the great ‘I AM.’ At this time these disciples needed to know that Jesus was much more than an earthly king, he was God. Jesus wanted to do for Peter, and the rest of the disciples the same thing that Yahweh did for Moses at the burning bush. He wanted to give them a new revelation of himself, but because of what was going on in Peter’s heart he was unable to grasp who Jesus really was. For Peter, walking on water, doing the spectacular became more important than responding in worship to a new revelation of Jesus.\n\nWhen our hearts and minds are dominated by our fears and insecurities, we will find it difficult to receive and respond to divine revelation because our focus will be on ourselves.\n\nAsk yourself, what did Peter achieve by stepping out of the boat?\n\nIt is true that Jesus invited him to come. But the reason why Jesus invited Peter was very different to the reason why Peter wanted to step out in the first place.",
