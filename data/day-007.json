  "scripture_text": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on\nahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he\nhad dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.\nLater that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a\nconsiderable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind\nwas against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on\nthe lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were\nterrified. \"It's a ghost,\"they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus\nimmediately said to them: \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\"\n\"Lord, if it's you,\" Peter replied, \"tell me to come to you on the\nwater.\" \"Come,\" he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked\non the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was\nafraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \"Lord, save me!\" Immediately\nJesus reached out his hand and caught him. \"You of little faith,\" he\nsaid, \"why did you doubt?\" And when they climbed into the boat, the\nwind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying,\n\"Truly you are the Son of God.",
  "devotional": "The backstory of Peter walking on the water ls fascinating and\nimportant. Jesus had just fed over 5000 people. In response to this, the\ncrowd wanted to take Jesus by force and make him king. See John 6:15.\n\nPeter could not understand why Jesus refused to be King. The crowds\nwanted to make Jesus king after he had fed them, but Jesus totally\nrefused. Instead he \"Made the disciples get into the boat\" He compelled\nthem. The word 'made' the NIV uses in Matthew 14:22 is sometimes\ntranslated 'compelled.' The Greek word is anagkazo. The word means to\ndrive or force. This word was used in surgery to describe the force\nrequired to repair dislocations.\n\nSometimes God has to force us into places that make no sense to us. We\nneed to experience the pain of having our hearts dislocated and wills\nrealigned.\n\nSometimes God's will for our lives can feel like a dislocation. There\nseems to be no alignment between our expectations and experience. Our\ntheology and circumstances can be at logger heads. What we expect from\nJesus does not tally with the Jesus of our every day lives and we\nstoically endure the discomfort of dislocations. Finding ourselves in a\nboat, heading into a storm seems awful timing, and yet being forced into\nthe boat was an expression of the painful faithfulness of God. Sometimes\nthe faithfulness of God can bring great pain into our lives, this is the\nvery same faithfulness that brings great blessing into our lives. God\nwill always be faithful to us, he will never be unfaithful to us, nor\ncan he ever be unfaithful to us. Sometimes the faithfulness of God can\nbe difficult,",
