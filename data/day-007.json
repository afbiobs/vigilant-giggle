After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”\n\nThe backstory of Peter walking on the water ls fascinating and important. Jesus had just fed over 5000 people. In response to this, the crowd wanted to take Jesus by force and make him king. See John 6:15.\n\nPeter could not understand why Jesus refused to be King. The crowds wanted to make Jesus king after he had fed them, but Jesus totally refused. Instead he “Made the disciples get into the boat” He compelled them. The word ‘made’ the NIV uses in Matthew 14:22 is sometimes translated ‘compelled.’ The Greek word is anagkazo. The word means to drive or force. This word was used in surgery to describe the force required to repair dislocations.\n\nSometimes God has to force us into places that make no sense to us. We need to experience the pain of having our hearts dislocated and wills realigned.\n\nSometimes God’s will for our lives can feel like a dislocation. There seems to be no alignment between our expectations and experience. Our theology and circumstances can be at logger heads. What we expect from Jesus does not tally with the Jesus of our every day lives and we stoically endure the discomfort of dislocations. Finding ourselves in a boat, heading into a storm seems awful timing, and yet being forced into the boat was an expression of the painful faithfulness of God. Sometimes the faithfulness of God can bring great pain into our lives, this is the very same faithfulness that brings great blessing into our lives. God will always be faithful to us, he will never be unfaithful to us, nor can he ever be unfaithful to us. Sometimes the faithfulness of God can be difficult,",
