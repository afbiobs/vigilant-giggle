After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”\n\nReasons for Peters insecurity.\n\nRegret or Failure of the past.\n\nThis is the second time we find Peter and the disciples in a storm. During the first storm the disciples did not respond very well. ‘Do you not care if we perish?’ In response to their panic Jesus said, “Why are you so afraid, do you still not believe?” See Mark 4:40, Matthew 8:26. Jesus is calling these men cowards and cowardliness is morally wrong, it is not a personality trait, we are told in the book of Revelations, ‘But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulphur. This is the second death.” Revelation 21:8. It is interesting to note that the list of sins in this verse begins with the ‘cowardly. Maybe we get involved with other sin because of a lack of courage. I think Peter may have remembered his lack of courage and how Jesus spoke to them during the first storm.\n\nThe word for fearful in this story is only found three times in the New Testament, Matthew 8:26, Mark 4:40 and Revelation 21:8 the word deilos carries the idea of the lack of moral resolve.\n\nIt is so easy for anyone of us to be controlled or become reactive to our failure of the past.
