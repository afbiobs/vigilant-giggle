After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.\n\nCan I suggest that the reason why Peter stepped out of the boat was more likely to do with self-doubt than doubt in Jesus; it was a desperate attempt to compensate for his own vulnerability and insecurity. Peter’s attempt to walk on water did not happen in an emotional vacuum; rather it was an outworking of a man dominated by his insecurity. Motivated by insecurity is akin to throwing away your ministry and making yourself the centre of your world.\n\nEverybody knows that Puma and Adidas are massive global brands reigning the arena of footwear and accessories. However, not everyone knows that both companies that compete for the same audience were founded by brothers Rudolf (“Rudi”) and Adolf (“Adi”) Dassler aka the Dassler brothers. Unfortunately, the relationship between the two brothers strained over the years making them ultimate rivals in business. Both brands started as the brainchild of the Dassler brothers living in Weimar, Germany in the 1920’s, initially working together to create the Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory. For a while, they were the only ones in Germany who manufactured sports shoes. World War II and certain personal disagreements led to hatred between the two brothers. Their feud led to the origin of Adidas and Puma in the year 1947, two giant shoe manufacturing companies, and started a long-lasting rivalry between the two companies. <a href=\"https://www.indiaretailing.com/2023/02/21/puma-and-adidas-were-founded-by-brothers/\">https://www.indiaretailing.com/2023/02/21/puma-and-adidas-were-founded-by-brothers/</a> accessed 20/03/2025\n\nThe reason I tell this, is that Peter may have been feeling a bit put out by the success of his brother Andrew.\n\nBeing overlooked in the present.\n\nBefore Jesus fed the 5000, he asked Philip and Andrew “Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?” (Perhaps Jesus saw in them a willingness to serve.) We’re really not sure why Andrew was asked, but he was the one who brought the young boy with the loaves and fish to Jesus and so it’s possible that Peter felt out-shone by Andrew.
