  "scripture_text": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on\nahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he\nhad dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.\nLater that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a\nconsiderable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind\nwas against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on\nthe lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were\nterrified. \"It's a ghost,\"they said, and cried out in fear. But\nJesus immediately said to them: \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be\nafraid.\" \"Lord, if it's you,\" Peter replied, \"tell me to come to you\non the water.\" \"Come,\" he said. Then Peter got down out of the\nboat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the\nwind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \"Lord, save me\"\nImmediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \"You of little\nfaith,\" he said, \"why did you doubt?\" And when they climbed into the\nboat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped\nhim, saying, \"Truly you are the Son of God.",
  "devotional": "Can I suggest that the reason why Peter stepped out of the boat was\nmore likely to do with self-doubt than doubt in Jesus; it was a\ndesperate attempt to compensate for his own vulnerability and\ninsecurity. Peter's attempt to walk on water did not happen in an\nemotional vacuum; rather it was an outworking of a man dominated by his\ninsecurity. Motivated by insecurity is akin to throwing away your\nministry and making yourself the centre of your world.\n\nEverybody knows that Puma and Adidas are massive global brands\nreigning the arena of footwear and accessories. However, not everyone\nknows that both companies that compete for the same audience were\nfounded by brothers Rudolf (\"Rudi\") and Adolf (\"Adi\") Dassler aka the\nDassler brothers. Unfortunately, the relationship between the two\nbrothers strained over the years making them ultimate rivals in\nbusiness. Both brands started as the brainchild of the Dassler brothers\nliving in Weimar, Germany in the 1920's, initially working together to\ncreate the Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory.

World War II and\ncertain personal disagreements led to hatred between the two brothers.\nTheir feud led to the origin of Adidas and Puma in the year 1947, two\ngiant shoe manufacturing companies, and started a long-lasting rivalry\nbetween the two companies.\n[https://www.indiaretailing.com/2023/02/21/puma-and-adidas-were-founded-by-brothers/](https://www.indiaretailing.com/2023/02/21/puma-and-adidas-were-founded-by-brothers/)\naccessed 20/03/2025\n\nThe reason I tell this, is that Peter may have been feeling a bit put\nout by the success of his brother Andrew.\n\nBeing overlooked in the present.\n\nBefore Jesus fed the 5000, he asked Philip and Andrew \"Where shall we\nbuy bread for these people to eat?\" (Perhaps Jesus saw in them a\nwillingness to serve.)
