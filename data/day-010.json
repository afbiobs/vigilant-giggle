  "devotional": "‘Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”\n\nTrouble in his present.\n\nWe read that the disciples were in trouble far away from land. The older versions use the word tossed for trouble. The Greek word basanizo originally means to test, to investigate, to examine and to put to the test. These disciples were in a storm, but also there was a storm inside them. They were in a boat, in a storm, but they were filled with uncertainty and confusion. What they were going through did not make any kind of sense. As most of them were fishermen, they knew that the last place you wanted to be was in a boat in a storm, and yet this is where Jesus told them to go. What was Jesus thinking?\n\nIn Mark 6:48 We read, ‘He [Jesus] saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. The Greek word used for straining is the Greek word ‘enantios’ which is used to describe the environment Peter and the other disciples found themselves in. The word ‘enantios’ carries the idea of hostility, or something being against you.\n\nMaybe you are finding that your familiar place is a struggle right now? Perhaps home, or your workplace, or church has become a place of ‘enantios,’ a place of struggle and hostility. And everything in you wants to step over the side and escape the ‘enantios’ the difficult situation that you’re facing.\n\nWhat should you do? Jump? Or stay and trust God in the storm?",
  "prayer": "-Father, thank you that you are the God of the ‘enantios.’ It is there where our hearts are revealed.",
