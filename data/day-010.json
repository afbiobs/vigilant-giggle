  "scripture_text": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on\nahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he\nhad dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.\nLater that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a\nconsiderable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind\nwas against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on\nthe lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were\nterrified. \"It's a ghost,\"they said, and cried out in fear. But\nJesus immediately said to them: \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be\nafraid.\" \"Lord, if it's you,\" Peter replied, \"tell me to come to you\non the water.\" \"Come,\" he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat,\nwalked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he\nwas afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \"Lord, save me!\"\nImmediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \"You of little\nfaith,\" he said, \"why did you doubt?\" And when they climbed into the\nboat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped\nhim, saying, \"Truly you are the Son of God.",
  "devotional": "Trouble in his present.\n\nWe read that the disciples were in trouble far away from land. The\nolder versions use the word tossed for trouble. The Greek word basanizo\noriginally means to test, to investigate, to examine and to put to the\ntest. These disciples were in a storm, but also there was a storm inside\nthem. They were in a boat, in a storm, but they were filled with\nuncertainty and confusion. What they were going through did not make any\nkind of sense. As most of them were fishermen, they knew that the last\nplace you wanted to be was in a boat in a storm, and yet this is where\nJesus told them to go. What was Jesus thinking?\n\nIn Mark 6:48 We read, 'He \\[Jesus\\] saw the disciples straining at the\noars, because the wind was against them. The Greek word used for\nstraining is the Greek word 'enantios' which is used to describe the\nenvironment Peter and the other disciples found themselves in. The word\n'enantios' carries the idea of hostility, or something being against\nyou.\n\nMaybe you are finding that your familiar place is a struggle right\nnow? Perhaps home, or your workplace, or church has become a place of\n'enantios,' a place of struggle and hostility. And everything in you\nwants to step over the side and escape the 'enantios' the difficult\nsituation that you're facing.\n\nWhat should you do? Jump? Or stay and trust God in the storm?",
