  "scripture_text": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on\nahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he\nhad dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.\nLater that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a\nconsiderable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind\nwas against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on\nthe lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were\nterrified. \"It's a ghost,\"they said, and cried out in fear. But\nJesus immediately said to them: \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be\nafraid.\" \"Lord, if it's you,\" Peter replied, \"tell me to come to you on\nthe water.\" \"Come,\" he said. Then Peter got down out of the\nboat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the\nwind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \"Lord, save\nme!\" Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \"You of\nlittle faith,\" he said, \"why did you doubt?\" And when they climbed\ninto the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat\nworshipped him, saying, \"Truly you are the Son of God.",
  "devotional": "Physical exhaustion.\n\nPeter, along with the other disciples was very tired. When we are\ntired, we loose perspective. Before the feeding of the 5000, Jesus tried\nto find a place to rest with his disciples, see Mark 6:30-31. When we\nbecome emotionally and physically drained our ability to make wise\nchoices is often diminished.\n\nWhen I was a young Christian I was often taught that busyness can lead\nto barrenness. I fully understand this sentiment and it is very true\nthat people can be so busy serving God that they never take a day of\nrest, or relax.\n\nBut maybe the real problem is that barrenness leads to busyness. In\nChristian circles people can live with constant fatigue, they live with\nan addiction to ministry and a loss sense of being dispensable. They end\nup as driven people who always feel they have something to prove. The\nloss of any sense off being dispensable is rooted in pride, and can\ncause people to mistakenly think that God needs them. The good news is\nthat God wants us, but he never has or never will need us.\n\nHow does the fact that you are not indispensable or even necessary for\nthe plans of God to be fulfilled make you feel?\n\nPeter's request for Jesus to tell him to come, he uses a strong word,\nkeleuō which means to command or order, Matthew 14:28. The same word is\nfound in verse 9 when Herod ordered the murder of John the Baptist, this\nwas a word used for a military command. Peter had almost a demanding\nattitude. He was looking for some kind of authority to justify him\ngetting out of the boat. He did not understand what he was going\nthrough, confusion, and doubt filled his heart. So he uses the 'call' of\nJesus, a call initiated by Peter, to avoid dealing with the stuff going\non in his heart.\n\n*Of course we would never do that; we would never hide behind the call\nof God!*\n\nHiding behind the call of God has become a popular occurrence amongst\nChristians, we say say things like 'God told me to ....' we utilize\nspiritual language or spiritual practices to justify our unspiritual\negotistical behaviour.\n\nIf we use what we perceive to be a call of God to avoid sorting out\nthe stuff that is going on in our hearts, we will need to eventually\nsink. Sinking will be a necessity so we can discover the grace of God.\n\n**Prayer:*-*Father, sometimes I feel so tired that I lose perspective\nand make bad choices.**",
