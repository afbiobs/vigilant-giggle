After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone,</b><b> and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.</b><b> When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear.</b><b> But Jesus immediately said to them: </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”</span></b><b> “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.”</b><b> </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“Come,” </span></b><b>he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”</b><b> Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“You of little faith,”</span></b><b> he said, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“why did you doubt?”</span></b><b> And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. </b><b>Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”</b></p>\n<p><b>Physical exhaustion. </b></p>\n<p><b>Peter, along with the other disciples was very tired. When we are tired, we loose perspective. Before the feeding of the 5000, Jesus tried to find a place to rest with his disciples, see Mark 6:30-31. When we become emotionally and physically drained our ability to make wise choices is often diminished. </b></p>\n<p><b>When I was a young Christian I was often taught that busyness can lead to barrenness. I fully understand this sentiment and it is very true that people can be so busy serving God that they never take a day of rest, or relax. </b></p>\n<p><b>But maybe the real problem is that barrenness leads to busyness. In Christian circles people can live with constant fatigue, they live with an addiction to ministry and a loss sense of being dispensable. They end up as driven people who always feel they have something to prove. The loss of any sense off being dispensable is rooted in pride, and can cause people to mistakenly think that God needs them. The good news is that God wants us, but he never has or never will need us. </b></p>\n<p><b>How does the fact that you are not indispensable or even necessary for the plans of God to be fulfilled make you feel?</b></p>\n<p><b>Peter’s request for Jesus to tell him to come, he uses a strong word, </b><b>keleuō which means to command or order, Matthew 14:28.  The same word is found in verse 9 when Herod ordered the murder of John the Baptist, this was a word used for a military command. Peter had almost a demanding attitude. He was looking for some kind of authority to justify him getting out of the boat. He did not understand what he was going through, confusion, and doubt filled his heart. So he uses the ‘call’ of Jesus, a call initiated by Peter, to avoid dealing with the stuff going on in his heart. </b></p>\n<p><i><b>Of course we would never do that; we would never hide behind the call of God! </b></i></p>\n<p><b>Hiding behind the call of God has become a popular occurrence amongst Christians, we say say things like ‘God told me to ….’ we utilize spiritual language or spiritual practices to justify our unspiritual egotistical behaviour.</b></p>\n<p><b>If we use what we perceive to be a call of God to avoid sorting out the stuff that is going on in our hearts, we will need to eventually sink.
