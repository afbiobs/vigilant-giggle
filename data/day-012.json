  "scripture_text": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on\nahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he\nhad dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.\nLater that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a\nconsiderable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind\nwas against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on\nthe lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were\nterrified. \"It's a ghost,\"they said, and cried out in fear.27But\nJesus immediately said to them: \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be\nafraid.\" \"Lord, if it's you,\" Peter replied, \"tell me to come to you\non the water.\" \"Come,\" he said. Then Peter got down out of the\nboat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the\nwind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \"Lord, save\nme!' Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \"You of\nlittle faith,\" he said, \"why did you doubt?\" And when they climbed\ninto the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat\nworshipped him, saying, \"Truly you are the Son of God.",

There is something in all of us that is tempted\nto think, that if we process a special ability or power, life would be a\nlot better or easier.\n\nIf Peter was to turn a God given power into a source of security, then\nhe would be in great danger of turning his ministry into a god, and an\nessential for life.
