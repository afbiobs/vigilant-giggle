After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear.27But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!’ Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”\n\nDo you realise that having the power to do the supernatural, will not make a person more secure? God was going to really use Peter in the future, therefore, it was important for him to learn that being gifted, even gifted to do supernatural things can never bring value, significance or security to a person.\n\nWe live in a generation that love the Marvel Movies. Movies that portray people with super human abilities. Being super human is a step towards de-humanisation. There is something in all of us that is tempted to think, that if we process a special ability or power, life would be a lot better or easier.\n\nIf Peter was to turn a God given power into a source of security, then he would be in great danger of turning his ministry into a god, and an essential for life. Peter walked on water, but did this make him more whole or secure?\n\nMaybe the best part of Peter’s experience at this time was that he he began to sink.",
