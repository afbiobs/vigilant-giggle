  "devotional": "“Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear.27But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”\n\nSometimes we need to begin to sink before we discover Jesus’ unconditional acceptance. As Peter began to sink in the water, he discovered the strong arms of Jesus’ love. At this moment Peter had a new and fresh revelation of Jesus’ saving power. The crowds wanted to make Jesus king after the feeding the 5000, but Jesus was more than a king, he is God who has the power to save.\n\nI am inclined to think that for Jesus this may have been one of the few times he suspended his humanity when he walked on water.\n\nI wonder what would have happened if Peter hadn’t began to sink? Would he have become proud? This was a hard lesson for Peter to learn, he was self confident, he liked to be in control, here he was learning that he did not have to do anything to earn Jesus’ love or acceptance.\n\nSometimes as Christians we hold unto a subliminal belief that we must prove ourselves in order to be accepted by God. We develop a nostalgic relationship with grace. We tie our experience of grace to some past experience like conversion, or some past service or trial.\n\nWe need revelation more than we need ability. Like Peter we will never conquer our insecurities with ability and achievement, we need a continual revelation and a growing understanding of who Jesus is. Revelation and understanding of Jesus is the bedrock of our security. Without these, we will become tired, exhausted people who continually strive for acceptance.\n\nThey worshipped Jesus.\n\nMatthew tells us ‘Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”\n\nThe problem is, circumstances and the demands of life are not often conducive to worship, they may even make worship feel inappropriate.\n\nAs they worshipped Jesus, their insecurities melted, and their prospectives changed. ‘Truly you are the Son of God.’ This was the first time they worshipped Jesus This was worship in response to revelation. As Christians we need more revelation so the difficult places in life can become places of worship.\n\nSometimes the last place we want to be is in the boat where we feel fearful, confused and uncertain of what is going on around us. We cannot join all the dots and make sense of our circumstances.\n\nHowever like Peter, we are on a journey that has been ordained by Jesus. He wants us to stay in the boat until it becomes a place of revelation and worship. That is the purpose of the journey, to discover who Jesus really is.",
