After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,”they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,”he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”\n\nThese verses are completely mind blowing, because for Jewish men to worship God in the form of a man, would have been culturally and theologically shocking. When you think about it, these circumstances were not conducive for a time of worship. Here were a group of disciples on the middle of a storm, they had no music, no ecstatic spiritual experience, just fear and insecurity.\n\nOften our circumstances and the demands of life are not conducive to worship, they may even make worship feel inappropriate. However the purpose of the journey, is to discover who Jesus really is. We need to develop a mindset that includes worship in every opportunity.
