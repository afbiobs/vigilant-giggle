  "devotional": "‘Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought, and there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’ For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’ And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth?”\n\nI want us to think about the importance of having spiritual ambition. Let us think about this for a moment. When you think about the future, do you ever think about what kind of Christian you would like to be? Do you ever sit and daydream about the kind of relationship you would love to have with God? Do you ever get excited about the possibility of really knowing God? Some of you may be thinking, what is he on? does he not live in the real world, with all it’s rough and tumble, all it’s pain and loss, all it’s demands and expectations, and he is dreaming about really knowing God!\n\nOften life can cause us to accept a ‘make do,’ kind of faith. A faith that is safe, neat, comfortable; a nice faith, free from any kind of determined ambition or life-shaping hunger. As we go through this parable we are going to discover a ’make do’ kind of faith is more a ‘won’t do’ kind of faith.\n\nAs I was thinking about this parable that Jesus told about the widow and the unjust judge, I began to think, ‘wouldn’t it be great to be a man of prayer.’ I think that is a good ambition. History is full of stories of how prayer made a difference. We have all got the potential to change history by engaging with God in prayer. Imagine being part of the positive change in someone's life through prayer.",
