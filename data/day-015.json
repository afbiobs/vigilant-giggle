  "scripture_text": "Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should\nalways pray and not give up. He said: \"In a certain town there was a\njudge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought, and there\nwas a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me\njustice against my adversary.' For some time he refused. But finally he\nsaid to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care what people\nthink, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she\ngets justice, so that she won't eventually come and attack me!' And the\nLord said, \"Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring\nabout justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night?\nWill he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get\njustice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes will he find\nfaith on the earth?",
  "devotional": "I want us to think about the importance of having spiritual ambition.\nLet us think about this for a moment. When you think about the future,\ndo you ever think about what kind of Christian you would like to be? Do\nyou ever sit and daydream about the kind of relationship you would love\nto have with God? Do you ever get excited about the possibility of\nreally knowing God? Some of you may be thinking, what is he on? does he\nnot live in the real world, with all it's rough and tumble, all it's\npain and loss, all it's demands and expectations, and he is dreaming\nabout really knowing God!\n\nOften life can cause us to accept a 'make do,' kind of faith. A faith\nthat is safe, neat, comfortable; a nice faith, free from any kind of\ndetermined ambition or life-shaping hunger. As we go through this\nparable we are going to discover a 'make do' kind of faith is more a\n'won't do' kind of faith.\n\nAs I was thinking about this parable that Jesus told about the widow\nand the unjust judge, I began to think, 'wouldn't it be great to be a\nman of prayer.' I think that is a good ambition. History is full of\nstories of how prayer made a difference. We have all got the potential\nto change history by engaging with God in prayer. Imagine being part of\nthe positive change in someone's life through prayer.",
