  "devotional": "‘Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’ “For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’” And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth?”\n\nHistory changed by prayer.\n\nThe fall of the Berlin wall is believed to be the result of prayer. For 28 years the Berlin Wall separated East from West; tearing apart families, friends and neighbours, and denying freedom to millions. The Soviet Union seemed invincible, threatening nuclear destruction, oppressing the innocent and persecuting Christians. Pastor Christian Fuehrer of Leipzig’s 800-year-old Nikolai Church had begun Monday prayer vigils which grew, until a month before the wall fell 8,000 people crammed into city centre churches with 70,000 more outside; carrying candles symbolising non-violence. One witness wrote, “They laid their candles at the feet of the armed soldiers and police.<br /> The steps of the STASI building –the organisation that spied on, abused and sold people out – now awash with candles looked like a river of peace and light.” The authorities didn’t know what to do. “We had everything planned. We were ready for anything − except candles and prayers,” one official said.",
