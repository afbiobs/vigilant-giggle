He said: \"In a certain town there was a\njudge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. And there\nwas a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me\njustice against my adversary.' \"For some time he refused. But finally he\nsaid to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care what people\nthink, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she\ngets justice, so that she won't eventually come and attack me!'\" And the\nLord said, \"Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring\nabout justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night?\nWill he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get\njustice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes will he find\nfaith on the earth?",
