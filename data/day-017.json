  "scripture_text": "Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should\nalways pray and not give up. He said: \"In a certain town there was a\njudge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. and there\nwas a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me\njustice against my adversary.' \"For some time he refused. But finally he\nsaid to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care what people\nthink, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she\ngets justice, so that she won't eventually come and attack me!' And the\nLord said, \"Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring\nabout justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night?\nWill he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get\njustice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes will he find\nfaith on the earth?",
  "devotional": "The history of prayer should create in us all, a good desire to become\nmen and women of prayer. However as I thought about having a desire to\nhave a life that is shaped and defined by prayer, on the surface this\nappeared to be a good and noble desire although, I realise in some ways\nthat it is not really recognising what Jesus is hoping for when he tells\nthis parable.\n\nWhen Jesus says that his disciples should always pray and never give\nup, he is not speaking about his hopes and aspirations of a few highly\ndedicated people who take prayer very seriously. Rather he is addressing\nan intrinsic need of every Christian. In other words, you and I have a\nGod given need to become people whose lives are being shaped by the\nongoing practice of prayer.\n\nRedefining the practice of prayer.\n\nWhen Jesus told this parable, He was saying that we 'should always\npray.' When these disciples heard this they would have been surprised.\nAccording to Leon Morris 'Jesus' teaching goes beyond that of the Jews,\nwho tended to limit the times of prayer lest they weary God. Three times\na day (on the model of [Daniel\n6:10](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Dan.%206.10)) was\naccepted as the\nmaximum'.[https://www.preceptaustin.org/luke-18-commentary](https://www.preceptaustin.org/luke-18-commentary).\nAccessed 23/04/2025\n\nLike the ancient Jews, we have developed a 'cookie cutter,' approach\nto prayer. What do I mean by that? We can develop a prayer life that\ntakes on a formalised shape. So we pray at a certain time in a certain\nplace and in a certain way. Now this is a great practice which should be\nencouraged, however, the problem is we can reduce our prayer lives to\nthis practice and not be fulfilling what Jesus said when he said, 'we\nought always to pray.' Is Jesus being unrealistic? Is he asking too\nmuch? No, what he is saying is that prayer and praying with others\nshould be a natural spontaneous reflection of our everyday lives.\n\nLet me give you a few simple examples:-\n\nYou're in the car and your in conversation with your spouse or a\nfriend, and as you talk, it may be a good thing to say, let us pray\nabout that issue. Our you get a round church prayer text about someone\nin the church, why not send them a prayer by text. Or you having a\nfamily discussion around the meal table, why not pray about the issue\nyou are talking about. Or if someone comes into your mind, just pray for\nthem. Or if you facing a difficulty a work, just stop and ask God for\nwisdom and help. The point is that prayer needs to be part of the fabric\nof life, of all of life, not just a 'cookie cutting' experience.",
