  "devotional": "‘Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. and there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’ “For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’ And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth?”\n\nThe history of prayer should create in us all, a good desire to become men and women of prayer. However as I thought about having a desire to have a life that is shaped and defined by prayer, on the surface this appeared to be a good and noble desire although, I realise in some ways that it is not really recognising what Jesus is hoping for when he tells this parable.\n\nWhen Jesus says that his disciples should always pray and never give up, he is not speaking about his hopes and aspirations of a few highly dedicated people who take prayer very seriously. Rather he is addressing an intrinsic need of every Christian. In other words, you and I have a God given need to become people whose lives are being shaped by the ongoing practice of prayer.\n\nRedefining the practice of prayer.\n\nWhen Jesus told this parable, He was saying that we ‘should always pray.’ When these disciples heard this they would have been surprised. According to Leon Morris ‘Jesus’ teaching goes beyond that of the Jews, who tended to limit the times of prayer lest they weary God. Three times a day (on the model of <a href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Dan.%206.10\">Daniel 6:10</a>) was accepted as the maximum’.<a href=\"https://www.preceptaustin.org/luke-18-commentary\">https://www.preceptaustin.org/luke-18-commentary</a>. Accessed 23/04/2025\n\nLike the ancient Jews, we have developed a ‘cookie cutter,’ approach to prayer. What do I mean by that? We can develop a prayer life that takes on a formalised shape. So we pray at a certain time in a certain place and in a certain way. Now this is a great practice which should be encouraged, however, the problem is we can reduce our prayer lives to this practice and not be fulfilling what Jesus said when he said, ‘we ought always to pray.’ Is Jesus being unrealistic? Is he asking too much? No, what he is saying is that prayer and praying with others should be a natural spontaneous reflection of our everyday lives.\n\nLet me give you a few simple examples:-\n\nYou’re in the car and your in conversation with your spouse or a friend, and as you talk, it may be a good thing to say, let us pray about that issue. Our you get a round church prayer text about someone in the church, why not send them a prayer by text. Or you having a family discussion around the meal table, why not pray about the issue you are talking about. Or if someone comes into your mind, just pray for them. Or if you facing a difficulty a work, just stop and ask God for wisdom and help. The point is that prayer needs to be part of the fabric of life, of all of life, not just a ‘cookie cutting’ experience.",
