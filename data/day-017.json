But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’ And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth?”</span></b>",

Our you get a round church prayer text about someone in the church, why not send them a prayer by text. Or you having a family discussion around the meal table, why not pray about the issue you are talking about. Or if someone comes into your mind, just pray for them. Or if you facing a difficulty a work, just stop and ask God for wisdom and help. The point is that prayer needs to be part of the fabric of life, of all of life, not just a ‘cookie cutting’ experience.</b></p>",
