  "devotional": "<p><b>Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. He said: </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God n cared what people thought. and there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’ “For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’ And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth?</span></b></p>\n<p><b>Understanding the reason for prayer.</b></p>\n<p><b>If I were to ask you why we should be a praying people, we would all come up with very different answers. But I don’t think many of us would have come up with the same answer as Jesus. When you read the NLT translation of 18:1 you could think that Jesus is saying something like, ‘you should always pray and never give up praying.,’ I am sure Jesus’ words may infer that, but that is not what he is saying. He is saying ‘incorporate prayer into every area of your life so you won’t grow weary, grow faint, loose heart and become overwhelmed with discouragement.’ Or to put it another way. Through prayer let your relationship with God be an integral part of every area of your life so you won’t be overwhelmed by the challenges that life brings.</b></p>\n<p><b>We need to keep in mind the context of the parable. Jesus had just taught about the coming kingdom. We do not know when Jesus will return to bring justice to his world. How long will it be? So how do we handle all the injustice we see all around us? How do we keep going and not give up?</b></p>\n<p><b>The word used for give up is the Greek word egkakeo, which means to not grow weary or lose heart, which in essence is really a &quot;positive&quot; admonition to keep on keeping on, to endure, to persevere despite obstacles, setbacks and adversaries.  But the word has a second meaning. It was used to describe the act of committing culpable neglect, or doing ill. Perhaps there can be a strong correlation between these two meanings, we give up and others suffer.</b></p>\n<p><b>Martin Luther said, ‘Prayer is the most important thing in my life. If I should neglect prayer for a single day, I should lose a great deal of the fire of faith.’</b></p>\n<p><b>The greatest motivation for prayer, is God himself.</b></p>\n<p><b>Often when you read the parables of Jesus it can be difficult to grasp what he is saying. We know that the purpose of this parable was to redefine our understanding of prayer. But the question, is how does it do that?  We can be sure that Jesus is not telling us that if we pray to God in the same way this widow, who wore this judge down with repeatedly pestering him, then God will answer us. That doesn’t mean that we should not be persistent in prayer. But the point of this parable is to show us how unlike God is to this unjust judge. Jesus is showing us a contrast between God and the unjust judge. This unjust judge answered this widows cry for justice, merely to shut her up, to get her off his back, he did it to get a quiet life. If a godless uncaring judge was prepared to give this widow what she needed, how much more will a loving God do. A God who cares for his chosen people who cry to him day and night.</b></p>\n<p><b>It can be very easy for anyone of us to become like this poor widow. She was destitute with no one to fight her corner. Her lack of confidence in the unjust judge fuelled her desperation. The more he resisted her cry for help the more desperate she became. Like the widow we too can allow a lack of confidence in God to produce in us an exhausting feeling of despair. Sometimes that despair is expressed in an unhealthy anger which feels like resentment towards God. At other times we can develop a silent desperation. Our confidence in God has gone and we stop praying, resigning ourselves to the belief that nothing will change. The writer of Hebrews tells us that we can ‘come with confidence to God’, (Hebrews 4:13). Having confidence in God is having a settled belief that God’s response to our prayers is always appropriate.  </b></p>\n<p><b>What Jesus is saying in this parable is very profound. The only way we can develop into people whose lives are defined by prayer is to know Gods character. The glorious goodness of God’s unchanging character will always stimulate prayer. </b></p>\n<p><b>Maybe one of the reasons why we struggle so much with prayer is because our distorted view of Him prevents us from really knowing him. As we gaze upon his beauty and are in awe of his glory we will find ourselves wanting to pray. God is nothing like this unjust judge, he is kind and compassionate, he cares and understands, and his heart is for us. That is why we can pray at all times.</b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus gives us a better understanding of the life of faith.</b></p>\n<p><b>In Luke 17, Jesus had been teaching on his second coming, and the parable of the widow and the unjust judge was given to help us to live faithful lives until Jesus returns. So in verse 8 Jesus says ’When the Son of man returns, how many will he find on earth who have faith.’ The scary thing about this verse is its context. Is Jesus using this parable as a means of gauging faithfulness? Is the faith he longs to see expressed through those who always pray and never give up? When Jesus returns, we all want to hear the words ‘Well done my good and faithful servant.’ In some ways this parable gives us all an opportunity to hear these words. Jesus could have defined faithfulness in lots of different ways, but He chose to use something that everyone of us can do no matter who we are, that is to pray always without giving up.</b></p>\n<p><b>Let me close with this question. ‘Would you like to become a man/woman of prayer, or do you need to become a man/woman of prayer?’   Let us not give up. Let us make prayer part of every area of our lives.</b></p>",
