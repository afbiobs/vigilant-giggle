  "devotional": "Understanding the reason for prayer.\n\nIf I were to ask you why we should be a praying people, we would all\ncome up with very different answers. But I don't think many of us would\nhave come up with the same answer as Jesus. When you read the NLT\ntranslation of 18:1 you could think that Jesus is saying something like,\n'you should always pray and never give up praying.,' I am sure Jesus'\nwords may infer that, but that is not what he is saying. He is saying\n'incorporate prayer into every area of your life so you won't grow\nweary, grow faint, loose heart and become overwhelmed with\ndiscouragement.' Or to put it another way. Through prayer let your\nrelationship with God be an integral part of every area of your life so\nyou won't be overwhelmed by the challenges that life brings.\n\nWe need to keep in mind the context of the parable. Jesus had just\ntaught about the coming kingdom. We do not know when Jesus will return\nto bring justice to his world. How long will it be? So how do we handle\nall the injustice we see all around us? How do we keep going and not\ngive up?\n\nThe word used for give up is the Greek word egkakeo, which means to\nnot grow weary or lose heart, which in essence is really a \\\"positive\\\"\nadmonition to keep on keeping on, to endure, to persevere despite\nobstacles, setbacks and adversaries. But the word has a second meaning.\nIt was used to describe the act of committing culpable neglect, or doing\nill. Perhaps there can be a strong correlation between these two\nmeanings, we give up and others suffer.\n\nMartin Luther said, 'Prayer is the most important thing in my life. If\nI should neglect prayer for a single day, I should lose a great deal of\nthe fire of faith.'\n\nThe greatest motivation for prayer, is God himself.\n\nOften when you read the parables of Jesus it can be difficult to grasp\nwhat he is saying. We know that the purpose of this parable was to\nredefine our understanding of prayer. But the question, is how does it\ndo that? We can be sure that Jesus is not telling us that if we pray to\nGod in the same way this widow, who wore this judge down with repeatedly\npestering him, then God will answer us. That doesn't mean that we should\nnot be persistent in prayer. But the point of this parable is to show us\nhow unlike God is to this unjust judge. Jesus is showing us a contrast\nbetween God and the unjust judge. This unjust judge answered this widows\ncry for justice, merely to shut her up, to get her off his back, he did\nit to get a quiet life. If a godless uncaring judge was prepared to give\nthis widow what she needed, how much more will a loving God do. A God\nwho cares for his chosen people who cry to him day and night.\n\nIt can be very easy for anyone of us to become like this poor widow.\nShe was destitute with no one to fight her corner. Her lack of\nconfidence in the unjust judge fuelled her desperation. The more he\nresisted her cry for help the more desperate she became. Like the widow\nwe too can allow a lack of confidence in God to produce in us an\nexhausting feeling of despair. Sometimes that despair is expressed in an\nunhealthy anger which feels like resentment towards God. At other times\nwe can develop a silent desperation. Our confidence in God has gone and\nwe stop praying, resigning ourselves to the belief that nothing will\nchange. The writer of Hebrews tells us that we can 'come with confidence\nto God', (Hebrews 4:13). Having confidence in God is having a settled\nbelief that God's response to our prayers is always appropriate.\n\nWhat Jesus is saying in this parable is very profound. The only way we\ncan develop into people whose lives are defined by prayer is to know\nGods character. The glorious goodness of God's unchanging character will\nalways stimulate prayer.\n\nMaybe one of the reasons why we struggle so much with prayer is\nbecause our distorted view of Him prevents us from really knowing him.\nAs we gaze upon his beauty and are in awe of his glory we will find\nourselves wanting to pray. God is nothing like this unjust judge, he is\nkind and compassionate, he cares and understands, and his heart is for\nus. That is why we can pray at all times.\n\nJesus gives us a better understanding of the life of faith.\n\nIn Luke 17, Jesus had been teaching on his second coming, and the\nparable of the widow and the unjust judge was given to help us to live\nfaithful lives until Jesus returns. So in verse 8 Jesus says 'When the\nSon of man returns, how many will he find on earth who have faith.' The\nscary thing about this verse is its context. Is Jesus using this parable\nas a means of gauging faithfulness? Is the faith he longs to see\nexpressed through those who always pray and never give up? When Jesus\nreturns, we all want to hear the words 'Well done my good and faithful\nservant.' In some ways this parable gives us all an opportunity to hear\nthese words. Jesus could have defined faithfulness in lots of different\nways, but He chose to use something that everyone of us can do no matter\nwho we are, that is to pray always without giving up.\n\nLet me close with this question. 'Would you like to become a man/woman\nof prayer, or do you need to become a man/woman of prayer?' Let us not\ngive up. Let us make prayer part of every area of our lives.",
