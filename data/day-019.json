The interesting thing about these verses is that Jesus does not talk about the ‘activities’ of the bad shepherds or their theology, but their characters.  </b></p>\n<p><b>A bad shepherd is someone who refuses to be honest with themselves. Look at the question they asked Jesus. </b><b>‘What? Are we blind too?’</b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> </span></b><b> John 9:40.  This is a very interesting question that reveals a lot about the Pharisees. They were unable to evaluate their own lives; they lived in denial, and could not cope with reality. They were blind to their blindness. They were unable to correctly evaluate their own spiritual condition. They found comfort in lying to themselves about themselves. Often people find it easier to deal with other peoples problems than deal with their own, this is a common form of denial and self-deception.</b></p>\n<p><b>A bad shepherd is some one who has a confused morality. Jesus said in response to the Pharisees question, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“If you were blind you would not be guilty of sin.”</span></b><b> In other words your claim not to be blind makes you more calculable for your sin. Because you think you have spiritual insight and understanding, you are more more guilty of sin. Any refusal on our part to make honest and spiritual evaluations about ourselves will result in us having wrong perceptions and making wrong judgements about others.</b></p>\n<p><b>A bad shepherd is one that lives under guilt. </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus concludes in verse 41 with saying </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.’</span></b><b>  Jesus is not speaking here about being motivated by guilt; rather he is speaking about living under the condemnation of God. To live under condemnation in essence means that a person has no freedom, they are condemned, and they are slaves to something or some one.

Rather, because of a flaw in their characters they were unwilling or unable to fulfil the role of a ‘good shepherd.’</b></p>",
