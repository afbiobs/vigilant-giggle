So\nwhen he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then\nthe wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he\nis a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. \"I am the good\nshepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me---just as the Father\nknows me and I know the Father---and I lay down my life for the sheep.\nI have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring\nthem also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one\nflock and one shepherd. The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down\nmy life---only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay\nit down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority\nto take it up again. This command I received from my Father.",
  "devotional": "John 10 is one of the best-loved chapters of the bible; for many\nChristians it has been a chapter that has brought much comfort and\nencouragement. Verses like, 'I have come that they may have life, and\nhave it to the full, 10:10 or I give them eternal life, and they shall\nnever perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.' 10:28\n\nThe problem is because it is so well known we are inclined to come to\nit with our assumptions. When Jesus first spoke these words they were\nnot intended to be a source of comfort or encouragement, rather they\nwere a challenge against the bad shepherding practices of the Pharisees\nand the religious leaders of His day.\n\nTo help us understand the context we need to go back and just take a\nquick look at the last few verse of chapter 9;40,41 Some Pharisees\nwho were with him heard him say this and asked, \"What? Are we blind\ntoo?\" Jesus said, \"If you were blind, you would not be guilty of\nsin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.\"\n\nIn those verses we are given a moral infantry of the Pharisees who\nwere bad shepherds of Gods people. The interesting thing about these\nverses is that Jesus does not talk about the 'activities' of the bad\nshepherds or their theology, but their characters.\n\nA bad shepherd is someone who refuses to be honest with themselves.\nLook at the question they asked Jesus. 'What? Are we blind too?' John\n9:40. This is a very interesting question that reveals a lot about the\nPharisees. They were unable to evaluate their own lives; they lived in\ndenial, and could not cope with reality. They were blind to their\nblindness. They were unable to correctly evaluate their own spiritual\ncondition. They found comfort in lying to themselves about themselves.\nOften people find it easier to deal with other peoples problems than\ndeal with their own, this is a common form of denial and\nself-deception.\n\nA bad shepherd is some one who has a confused morality. Jesus said in\nresponse to the Pharisees question, \"If you were blind you would not be\nguilty of sin.\" In other words your claim not to be blind makes you more\ncalculable for your sin. Because you think you have spiritual insight\nand understanding, you are more more guilty of sin. Any refusal on our\npart to make honest and spiritual evaluations about ourselves will\nresult in us having wrong perceptions and making wrong judgements about\nothers.\n\nA bad shepherd is one that lives under guilt.\n\nJesus concludes in verse 41 with saying 'but now that you claim you\ncan see, your guilt remains.' Jesus is not speaking here about being\nmotivated by guilt; rather he is speaking about living under the\ncondemnation of God. To live under condemnation in essence means that a\nperson has no freedom, they are condemned, and they are slaves to\nsomething or some one. Without freedom we will not be able to serve\nothers.\n\nThe bad shepherd is someone who lacks honesty, morality and freedom.\n\nThese people may not have set out with the intention of being bad in\nthe sense that they are unable to implement good pastoral care for\nothers, rather their bad shepherding is the symptomatic and spontaneous\nresult of their character. They were unable to do the good things that a\ngood shepherd should do, not because they were uninformed about the\nresponsibilities of a shepherd. Rather, because of a flaw in their\ncharacters they were unwilling or unable to fulfil the role of a 'good\nshepherd.'",
