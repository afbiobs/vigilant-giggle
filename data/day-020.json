It is very easy to put a post-Calvary interpretation on what Jesus is saying here, and assume that Jesus is speaking about his death on the cross, but in doing this we are taking the verses out of context, and missing the point. </b></p>\n<p><b>Although there may be an allusion to the death of Jesus, this is not its main point.</b></p>\n<p><b>In making this passage about the death of Jesus, we will subconsciously detach or distance ourselves from it. This will cause us to turn ministry into more of a convenience than a calling, because we will never believe that God would expect us to ‘lay down our lives for the sheep;’ yet this is precisely what God expects. Irrespective of the ministry we may have been called to, it will require us to live a ‘laid down’ life. Irrespective of the gifts we may or may not have, we will need to live a laid down life, if we are gong to authentically reflect Jesus and meet the needs of others.</b></p>\n<p><b>The people who originally heard Jesus speak these words, would not have associated them with His redeeming death on a cross.  </b></p>\n<p><b>A good shepherd will risk his life to protect the sheep, but that is different from laying down one&#x27;s life. The shepherd, who risks his life for the sheep does not expect to die, but expects to live. Occasionally, a shepherd will die in an encounter with animals or thieves, but most will not. They plan, not to lay down their lives through death, but to lay down their lives through a living a selfless life.  </b></p>\n<p><b>A wise shepherd would not plan on loosing his life,  for he knows that this would be of no benefit to his sheep; he may have an accident, or he might be attacked by thieves and robbers, but to deliberately plan to loose his life would be very serious for his flock. A shepherd who dies, leaves the sheep defenceless, so the only good shepherd is one who is alive.</b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus did not lay down his life on the cross. The cross was only possible because he had already laid down his life.</b></p>\n<p><b>So what does it mean to ‘Lay down your life?’   </b></p>\n<p><b>The word Jesus uses four times in this passage for lay down is the Greek word tithemi which means to set in place, to establish, to ordain. In Acts 20 v28 Paul has summoned the elders from Ephesus together and to them he says, &quot;Take heed therefore to yourselves and to the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.&quot;  The word &quot;made&quot; is a translation of the Greek word tithemi</b><i><b>. </b></i><b>1 Tim 2:7: Paul was ordained a preacher and an apostle. The word &quot;ordained&quot; is the Greek word tithemi.</b></p>\n<p><b>So to ‘lay down’ your life is to have your life in the right place, to find God’s ordained purpose for it.</b></p>",
