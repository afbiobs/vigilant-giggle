  "devotional": "I am the Good Shepherd\n\nWhen Jesus says 'I am the Good shepherd and the Good Shepherd lays\ndown his life for His sheep,' what is He saying? It is very easy to put\na post-Calvary interpretation on what Jesus is saying here, and assume\nthat Jesus is speaking about his death on the cross, but in doing this\nwe are taking the verses out of context, and missing the point.\n\nAlthough there may be an allusion to the death of Jesus, this is not\nits main point.\n\nIn making this passage about the death of Jesus, we will\nsubconsciously detach or distance ourselves from it. This will cause us\nto turn ministry into more of a convenience than a calling, because we\nwill never believe that God would expect us to 'lay down our lives for\nthe sheep;' yet this is precisely what God expects. Irrespective of the\nministry we may have been called to, it will require us to live a 'laid\ndown' life. Irrespective of the gifts we may or may not have, we will\nneed to live a laid down life, if we are gong to authentically reflect\nJesus and meet the needs of others.\n\nThe people who originally heard Jesus speak these words, would not\nhave associated them with His redeeming death on a cross.\n\nA good shepherd will risk his life to protect the sheep, but that is\ndifferent from laying down one's life. The shepherd, who risks his life\nfor the sheep does not expect to die, but expects to live. Occasionally,\na shepherd will die in an encounter with animals or thieves, but most\nwill not. They plan, not to lay down their lives through death, but to\nlay down their lives through a living a selfless life.\n\nA wise shepherd would not plan on loosing his life, for he knows that\nthis would be of no benefit to his sheep; he may have an accident, or he\nmight be attacked by thieves and robbers, but to deliberately plan to\nloose his life would be very serious for his flock. A shepherd who dies,\nleaves the sheep defenceless, so the only good shepherd is one who is\nalive.\n\nJesus did not lay down his life on the cross. The cross was only\npossible because he had already laid down his life.\n\nSo what does it mean to 'Lay down your life?'\n\n**The word Jesus uses four times in this passage for lay down is the\nGreek word tithemi which means to set in place, to establish, to ordain.\nIn Acts 20 v28 Paul has summoned the elders from Ephesus together and to\nthem he says, \\\"Take heed therefore to yourselves and to the flock over\nwhich the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.\\\" The word \\\"made\\\" is a\ntranslation of the Greek word tithemi*.* 1 Tim 2:7: Paul was ordained a\npreacher and an apostle. The word \\\"ordained\\\" is the Greek word\ntithemi.**\n\nSo to 'lay down' your life is to have your life in the right place, to\nfind God's ordained purpose for it.",
