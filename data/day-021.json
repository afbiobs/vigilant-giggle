A guiding principle in working the practical implications of living\na 'Laid down life,' is that your paramount concern is the welfare and\nneeds of others.\n\nHow do we lay down our lives?\n\nAs we unpack this passage we will discover that we will never lay down\nour lives if we are motivated with shame or guilt. Nor will we be able\nto lay down our lives simply by determination or effort; rather the life\nthat is laid down for the sake of others is first and foremost an\nexpression of character. Laying down our lives for others is more about\nan expression of our natures than it is about responding to the needs of\nothers. Jesus gives four reasons why he lay down his life for the sheep.\nIt is more about the people we are than the spiritual gifts we may\nhave.\n\n\\[a\\] The Good shepherd lays down his life because He is good.\n\n'I am the good shepherd, and the good shepherd lays down his life for\nthe sheep.' The word good (Greek: kalos) shepherd. Barclay notes that\nthere are two Greek words for good. The first is agathos, which \\\"simply\ndescribes the moral quality of a thing.\\\" The second is kalos, \\\"which\nmeans that a thing or a person is not only good; but in the goodness\nthere is a quality of winsomeness, loveliness, attractiveness which\nmakes it a lovely thing.\\\" It refers to someone who was more than just a\ngood person.\n[https://www.trinitycoatesville.org/sermons/whats-good-about-a-shepherd-2](https://www.trinitycoatesville.org/sermons/whats-good-about-a-shepherd-2)\n(Accessed 10/04/25)\n\nThey would also be someone that we could count on to be there for us\nin a time of crisis.

The implications of these words are\nvery scary. If we were to have the same kind of relationships with\npeople that we have with God, what kind of community would we be? The\nheart attitudes that a person needs to know and love God, are the same\nheart attitudes we need to know and love people.\n\nWe cannot say that we love God and hate our brother. The only way we\ncan lay down our lives for God is to lay it down for people\n\nBecause Jesus knew his sheep he laid down his life. It is easier to\nlive a sacrificial life in order to help a friend than it is to help a\nstranger.\n\nMany people in positions of leadership struggle with fulfilling their\nGod given responsibilities because they are emotionally disengaged from\nthose they are trying to serve and lead.
