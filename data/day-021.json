The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away.Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. “I am the good shepherd; know my sheep and my sheep know me—just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span></b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">  have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen.

I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.”</span></b></p>\n<p><b>To ‘lay down’ your life is to live as a sacrifice so you can spontaneously minister unto the needs of others.  </b></p>\n<p><b>To lay down your life is to cultivate a mindset that refuses to allow your life to function on the basis of selfishness.</b></p>\n<p><b>Laying down your life is more about character than heroism; it is more about the simple, apparently incidental life choices we make every day, than some gallant grand gesture we might make in the face of some crisis or calamity.</b></p>\n<p><b>Laying down your life is to see every day as an opportunity to serve and encourage others.</b></p>\n<p><b>I think if we make it into some kind of super heroic act, it robs us of the honour of exercising everyday mundane servant-hood.</b></p>\n<p><b>The only way we can avoid laying down our lives is to resist the purposes of God and live outside his will.</b></p>\n<p><b>Laying down your life will look very different for different people, and how it looks in practical terms is up to every individual to work out. A guiding principle in working the practical implications of living a ‘Laid down life,’ is that your paramount concern is the welfare and needs of others.</b></p>\n<p><b>How do we lay down our lives?</b></p>\n<p><b>As we unpack this passage we will discover that we will never lay down our lives if we are motivated with shame or guilt. Nor will we be able to lay down our lives simply by determination or effort; rather the life that is laid down for the sake of others is first and foremost an expression of character. Laying down our lives for others is more about an expression of our natures than it is about responding to the needs of others. Jesus gives four reasons why he lay down his life for the sheep. It is more about the people we are than the spiritual gifts we may have.</b></p>\n<p><b>[a] The Good shepherd lays down his life because He is good.</b></p>\n<p><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘I am the good shepherd, and the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.’</span></b><b> The word good (Greek: kalos) shepherd. Barclay notes that there are two Greek words for good. The first is agathos, which &quot;simply describes the moral quality of a thing.&quot; The second is kalos, &quot;which means that a thing or a person is not only good; but in the goodness there is a quality of winsomeness, loveliness, attractiveness which makes it a lovely thing.&quot; It refers to someone who was more than just a good person. </b><a href=\"https://www.trinitycoatesville.org/sermons/whats-good-about-a-shepherd-2\">https://www.trinitycoatesville.org/sermons/whats-good-about-a-shepherd-2</a><b> (Accessed 10/04/25)</b></p>\n<p><b>They would also be someone that we could count on to be there for us in a time of crisis.
