  "scripture_text": "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for\nthe sheep. The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the\nsheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs\naway.Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away\nbecause he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. \"I am the\ngood shepherd; know my sheep and my sheep know me---just as the Father\nknows me and I know the Father---and I lay down my life for the sheep.\nhave other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them\nalso. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and\none shepherd The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my\nlife---only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay\nit down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority\nto take it up again. This command I received from my Father.",
  "devotional": "We have been thinking about how Jesus laid down his life for the\nsheep. He did it because his sheep know him. Jesus said 'I know my sheep\nand my sheep know me.'\n\nPart of the process of laying down your life is to become known. It is\nto open yourself up, becoming vulnerable, sharing your pain, weaknesses,\nand sin. The laid down life is one were there are no masks, pretences or\nperformances, but honest openness. Knowing and being known are essential\nif we are going to find God's appointed place for our lives.\n\n'The reason why my Father loves me is that I lay down my life.'\n\nIt would be very easy to conclude from this verse that Jesus was\nsaying that he needed to earn his father's love by laying down his life.\nWe know from the scriptures that God's love cannot be bought or earned,\nso how are we to understand these words?\n\nCould it be that Jesus' willing sacrifice elicited the Father's\neternal love in a fresh way? For example, I have loved my wife for over\n25 years. Now if she does something that reflects her love for me, which\nwould cause my love for her to well up in a fresh way so that I say, \"I\nlove you for doing that for me.\" The love was there before her deed, but\nher deed called forth my love once more.\n\nI think Jesus is saying that when he laid down his life it did not\ncause God to love his Son. But it caused the love God had for his Son to\nto well up inside him. Maybe this is Jesus' way of saying that the laid\ndown life brings great joy and pleasure to God. The laying down of\nJesus' life for the sheep, is an act that expresses to the world, that\nJesus felt secure in his father's love. Because Jesus felt secure in his\nfather's love he was prepared to lay down his life and eventually die on\nthe cross.\n\nThe kind of 'laid down life' that God is looking for is only possible\nwhen we are feeling secure in the love of God. Feelings of insecurity\nwill prevent a person from living a sacrificial laid down life, because\ninsecurity encourages and develops selfishness within a person. The more\nwe receive and enjoy God's love the more secure we will be, and the more\nsecure we are the more equipped we will be to lay down our lives.\n\nThe security Jesus felt, meant that he had the authority to lay down\nhis life. 'No one takes it from me but I lay it down of my own accord. I\nhave authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again.' This\nis alluding to Jesus' death, but in this context it is primarily\nreferring to how Jesus lived. The word that John uses for authority\nliterally means 'unrestricted possibility or freedom of action.' In\nother words Jesus was free enough to lay down his life.\n\nWhen a person is free because they feel secure in the love of God,\nthey will be prepared to meet the demands and sacrifices that the\nChristian life requires. We cannot live the life of a Christian without\na conscious knowledge of God's love. Knowledge of God's love is the most\neffective sanctifying and freeing influence a person can experience.\n\nIn laying down his life for others Jesus was outworking the natural\nconsequences of obeying his Father's commandments. 'I have authority to\nlay it down and authority to take it up again. This commandment I have\nreceived from my father.'\n\nIn our western culture we have over individualised obedience, but\nevery time we obey the word of God, it is not solely for our own\nindividual and personal benefit, but it is also for the enrichment and\nencouragement of others. Obedience to the commandments will equip a\nperson for his ordination, it will make a laid down life a reality.\n\nWith that in mind, let me mention our understanding of abundant that\nJesus refers to in verse 10. Abundant life is not an individualistic\nexperience; rather it is the result of feeling secure within the flock.\nAbundant life is a relational quality that is discovered in the midst of\ncommunity. Abundant life is an impossible individual experience.",
