So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs\naway. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away\nbecause he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. \"I am the\ngood shepherd; know my sheep and my sheep know me---just as the Father\nknows me and I know the Father---and I lay down my life for the sheep.\nhave other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them\nalso. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and\none shepherd The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my\nlife---only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay\nit down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority\nto take it up again. This command I received from my Father.",
  "devotional": "Understanding the hired hand.\n\nIt is important that we look at the role of the hired hand as\ndescribed in verses 12-13. The description Jesus gives us of the hired\nhand is the antithesis of a laid down life. The life that is laid down\nis the opposite in attitude and actions of the hired hand.\n\nMany people, when they read what Jesus says about the hired hand think\nthat he was someone who set out with the premeditated intention to harm\nthe sheep and cause havoc in the flock. Jesus says. 'The hired hand is\nnot the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees a wolf coming he\nabandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and\nscatters it. The man runs because he is a hired hand and cares nothing\nabout the sheep.'\n\n**There is nothing bad or wrong about being a hired hand. The word John\nuses is *misthotos* was used to refer to day labourers working for a\nwage of normally one drachma per day. It is unlikely a shepherd would\nhire a hand for the day, if he knew that the hired hand was intending to\nharm his flock and destroy his livelihood.\n\nAlthough this hired hand did not set out with the intended purpose of\nharming the sheep, the pressures and demands of the job exposed flaws in\nhis character, which made him a threat to the sheep.\n\nSo what kind of person was this?\n\nHe had more fear than courage. Because of his lack of courage he was\ncontrolled by fear, making him unable to fulfil his responsibilities and\ndeal with the realities of the job, 'when he sees a wolf coming he\nabandons the sheep and runs away.' Our level of commitment to people is\nreflected in the amount of courage we show.\n\nOften people can begin a ministry with every intention of being\nfaithful and committed to the work God has called them to; often they\nstart with every intention of showing care, however, when problems arise\nthey can abandon their responsibilities because of a lack of care and\ncourage.\n\nHe is more concerned with the protection of self than the protection\nof the sheep. Jesus said 'when he sees a wolf coming he abandons the\nsheep and runs away.'\n\nNotice that this hired hand had no contact with the wolf; he didn't\nabandon the sheep after he had some physical contact with the wolf, but\nwhen he saw the wolf he ran away.\n\nThe word that John uses for 'see' in this passage is the Greek word\ntheoreo. Theoreo denotes 'deliberate contemplation.' The perceptions we\nhold are never accidental or enforced upon us, rather they are the\nresult of deliberate and considered thinking, be that right or wrong. So\nwhen this hireling saw the wolf his understanding and considered\nconclusion was, 'I'm scared I need to get out of here.' His running and\nabandoning the sheep may have the appearance of being spontaneous and\nnot thought through, but it wasn't. It was the result of deliberately\nformed perceptions that governed his life.\n\nThe hired hand in Jesus' story was more concerned about himself than\nhe was about the sheep; it was natural for him to avoid difficulties and\nconfrontation in order to save his own skin. A bad shepherd will avoid\nconfrontation, and refuse to deal with problems that may arise in case\nhe damages his reputation, for him pleasing people is more important\nthan facing and tackling difficult issues.\n\nThis hired hand had unrealistic expectations.\n\nWas he surprised that a wolf would attack the flock? Was he not hired\nwith the expressed purpose of protecting the sheep from possible\npredators like wolves? This hired hand was not prepared for something\nthat was likely to happen 'The hired hand will run away.' Twice Jesus\ntells us that the hired hand will run. 'He abandons the sheep and runs\naway.' The word for run is the Greek word *pheugo* where we get our\nEnglish word fugitive from; it literally means 'to seek safety in\nflight' or 'to escape from danger.'**\n\nIn Christian ministry and in life, people often run away, sometimes\nthis literally means running away, leaving work or moving\ngeographically. But more often the running away can be a more subtle and\nless obvious. People become emotionally detached, they build walls, they\nloose their passion, doing the very least they can get away with doing,\nfor in their hearts they have run away.\n\nRunning away is never a benign or an exclusively individual\nexperience, Jesus tells us. 'Then the wolf attacks the flock and\nscatters it.' In other words, when we run others suffer. Running away\nmay feel totally personal, but it never is and never can be. When we are\ntrying to avoid truth, responsibilities or circumstances, others will\nsuffer because of our avoidance of reality.\n\nThe word used for scatter is the Greek word \\\"skorpizo.\\\" The root of\nthe verb means, 'to pierce!' It gives us the English word \\\"scorpion.\\\"\nHaving a lack of courage, pursuing self-protection and running away from\nresponsibilities, circumstances and truth will be a sting in the tail to\nothers.\n\nHow should we handle the wolves when they come?\n\nThe only way we will have the courage and the spiritual resources to\nface the wolves, i.e. the demanding challenges that will confronts us,\nis to live a 'laid down' life. If we have already laid down our lives,\nthen we will not fear what any predator may do to us.\n\nBeing a good shepherd is very difficult, demanding and challenging.\nHowever, to be like this hired hand and run because of a lack of\ncourage, (although may appear the easier option), will cause untold harm\nto God's flock. So if we want to live the life that Jesus did, we need\nto be willing to 'lay down' our lives.",
