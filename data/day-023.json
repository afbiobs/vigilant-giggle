The description Jesus gives us of the hired hand is the antithesis of a laid down life. The life that is laid down is the opposite in attitude and actions of the hired hand.</b></p>\n<p><b>Many people, when they read what Jesus says about the hired hand think that he was someone who set out with the premeditated intention to harm the sheep and cause havoc in the flock.  Jesus says. </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘The hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees a wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away.

The word John uses is </b><i><b>misthotos</b></i><b> was used to refer to day labourers working for a wage of normally one drachma per day. It is unlikely a shepherd would hire a hand for the day, if he knew that the hired hand was intending to harm his flock and destroy his livelihood.</b></p>\n<p><b>Although this hired hand did not set out with the intended purpose of harming the sheep, the pressures and demands of the job exposed flaws in his character, which made him a threat to the sheep. </b></p>\n<p><b>So what kind of person was this?</b></p>\n<p><b>He had more fear than courage.  Because of his lack of courage he was controlled by fear, making him unable to fulfil his responsibilities and deal with the realities of the job, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘when he sees a wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away.’</span></b><b>  Our level of commitment to people is reflected in the amount of courage we show.</b></p>\n<p><b>Often people can begin a ministry with every intention of being faithful and committed to the work God has called them to; often they start with every intention of showing care, however, when problems arise they can abandon their responsibilities because of a lack of care and courage. </b></p>\n<p><b>He is more concerned with the protection of self than the protection of the sheep. Jesus said </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘when he sees a wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away.’</span></b><b>  </b></p>\n<p><b>Notice that this hired hand had no contact with the wolf; he didn’t abandon the sheep after he had some physical contact with the wolf, but when he saw the wolf he ran away.   </b></p>\n<p><b>The word that John uses for ‘see’ in this passage is the Greek word theoreo. Theoreo denotes ‘deliberate contemplation.’ The perceptions we hold are never accidental or enforced upon us, rather they are the result of deliberate and considered thinking, be that right or wrong. So when this hireling saw the wolf his understanding and considered conclusion was, ‘I’m scared I need to get out of here.’   His running and abandoning the sheep may have the appearance of being spontaneous and not thought through, but it wasn’t.

Running away may feel totally personal, but it never is and never can be. When we are trying to avoid truth, responsibilities or circumstances, others will suffer because of our avoidance of reality.</b></p>\n<p><b>The word used for scatter is the Greek word &quot;skorpizo.&quot; The root of the verb means, ‘to pierce!’  It gives us the English word &quot;scorpion.&quot;  Having a lack of courage, pursuing self-protection and running away from responsibilities, circumstances and truth will be a sting in the tail to others.  </b></p>\n<p><b>How should we handle the wolves when they come?</b></p>\n<p><b>The only way we will have the courage and the spiritual resources to face the wolves, i.e. the demanding challenges that will confronts us, is to live a ‘laid down’ life.
