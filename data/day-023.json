So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. “I am the good shepherd; know my sheep and my sheep know me—just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep. have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.”\n\nUnderstanding the hired hand.\n\nIt is important that we look at the role of the hired hand as described in verses 12-13. The description Jesus gives us of the hired hand is the antithesis of a laid down life. The life that is laid down is the opposite in attitude and actions of the hired hand.\n\nMany people, when they read what Jesus says about the hired hand think that he was someone who set out with the premeditated intention to harm the sheep and cause havoc in the flock. Jesus says. ‘The hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees a wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs because he is a hired hand and cares nothing about the sheep.’\n\nThere is nothing bad or wrong about being a hired hand. The word John uses is misthotos was used to refer to day labourers working for a wage of normally one drachma per day. It is unlikely a shepherd would hire a hand for the day, if he knew that the hired hand was intending to harm his flock and destroy his livelihood.\n\nAlthough this hired hand did not set out with the intended purpose of harming the sheep, the pressures and demands of the job exposed flaws in his character, which made him a threat to the sheep.\n\nSo what kind of person was this?\n\nHe had more fear than courage. Because of his lack of courage he was controlled by fear, making him unable to fulfil his responsibilities and deal with the realities of the job, ‘when he sees a wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away.’ Our level of commitment to people is reflected in the amount of courage we show.\n\nOften people can begin a ministry with every intention of being faithful and committed to the work God has called them to; often they start with every intention of showing care, however, when problems arise they can abandon their responsibilities because of a lack of care and courage.\n\nHe is more concerned with the protection of self than the protection of the sheep. Jesus said ‘when he sees a wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away.’\n\nNotice that this hired hand had no contact with the wolf; he didn’t abandon the sheep after he had some physical contact with the wolf, but when he saw the wolf he ran away.\n\nThe word that John uses for ‘see’ in this passage is the Greek word theoreo. Theoreo denotes ‘deliberate contemplation.’ The perceptions we hold are never accidental or enforced upon us, rather they are the result of deliberate and considered thinking, be that right or wrong. So when this hireling saw the wolf his understanding and considered conclusion was, ‘I’m scared I need to get out of here.’ His running and abandoning the sheep may have the appearance of being spontaneous and not thought through, but it wasn’t. It was the result of deliberately formed perceptions that governed his life.\n\nThe hired hand in Jesus’ story was more concerned about himself than he was about the sheep; it was natural for him to avoid difficulties and confrontation in order to save his own skin. A bad shepherd will avoid confrontation, and refuse to deal with problems that may arise in case he damages his reputation, for him pleasing people is more important than facing and tackling difficult issues.\n\nThis hired hand had unrealistic expectations.\n\nWas he surprised that a wolf would attack the flock? Was he not hired with the expressed purpose of protecting the sheep from possible predators like wolves? This hired hand was not prepared for something that was likely to happen ‘The hired hand will run away.’ Twice Jesus tells us that the hired hand will run. ‘He abandons the sheep and runs away.’ The word for run is the Greek word pheugo where we get our English word fugitive from; it literally means ‘to seek safety in flight’ or ‘to escape from danger.’\n\nIn Christian ministry and in life, people often run away, sometimes this literally means running away, leaving work or moving geographically. But more often the running away can be a more subtle and less obvious. People become emotionally detached, they build walls, they loose their passion, doing the very least they can get away with doing, for in their hearts they have run away.\n\nRunning away is never a benign or an exclusively individual experience, Jesus tells us. ‘Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.’ In other words, when we run others suffer. Running away may feel totally personal, but it never is and never can be. When we are trying to avoid truth, responsibilities or circumstances, others will suffer because of our avoidance of reality.\n\nThe word used for scatter is the Greek word \"skorpizo.\" The root of the verb means, ‘to pierce!’ It gives us the English word \"scorpion.\" Having a lack of courage, pursuing self-protection and running away from responsibilities, circumstances and truth will be a sting in the tail to others.\n\nHow should we handle the wolves when they come?\n\nThe only way we will have the courage and the spiritual resources to face the wolves, i.e. the demanding challenges that will confronts us, is to live a ‘laid down’ life. If we have already laid down our lives, then we will not fear what any predator may do to us.\n\nBeing a good shepherd is very difficult, demanding and challenging. However, to be like this hired hand and run because of a lack of courage, (although may appear the easier option), will cause untold harm to God’s flock. So if we want to live the life that Jesus did, we need to be willing to ‘lay down’ our lives.",
