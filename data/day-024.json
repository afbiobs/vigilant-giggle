They gathered in such large number that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralysed man,</b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> “Son, your sins are forgiven.”</span></b><b> Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming!

Jesus did not only bless, heal and set people free through his miracles, but he challenged the status-quo.  Some of his miracles were like exploding grenades that brought down the walls established theological structures that had kept the Jewish belief system in place for hundred’s of years. In our day people use the phrase ‘politically correct,’ well you could say that sometimes the miracles of Jesus were perceived as not being ‘theologically correct,’ They caused offence and disquiet.
