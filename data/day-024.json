  "devotional": "‘A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. They gathered in such large number that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralysed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to this paralysed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”So he said to the man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home .” full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”\n\nI wonder how you feel about miracles? You may have a positive response to that question, and rightly so. However, if we were to delve a little deeper into Jesus miracles we would discover that they are subversive in nature. Jesus did not only bless, heal and set people free through his miracles, but he challenged the status-quo. Some of his miracles were like exploding grenades that brought down the walls established theological structures that had kept the Jewish belief system in place for hundred’s of years. In our day people use the phrase ‘politically correct,’ well you could say that sometimes the miracles of Jesus were perceived as not being ‘theologically correct,’ They caused offence and disquiet. We have sanitised some of the miracle stories of Jesus, making them into nice, wee, twee stories that make us feel good about ourselves. Somehow, by default we manage to ignore their subversive, disturbing side, maybe that suits us?\n\nJesus has not changed; through his kingdom, he continues to subvert everything this world stands for. Through the lives and ministry of people like us, Jesus wants to be a threat to the oppressive unjust systems that control and destroy people. As Christians we ought to be the biggest threat to sinful systems, and organised religion that are dominate our society.\n\nJournalist Peter Hitchens the brother of famous atheist Christphour Hitchens. was a part of a panel discussion at a large conference. An audience member asked, “What so called dangerous idea would have the potential to change the world for the better if implemented?” After another contributor responded saying his dangerous idea would be population control with mandatory abortions for pregnant women. When Peter was asked this is what he said\n\n“The most dangerous idea in human history and philosophy remains the belief that Jesus Christ was the Son of God and rose from the dead. And that is the most dangerous idea you will ever encounter,” he said. When asked a follow up question, Peter responded, “[the resurrection of Jesus] alters the whole of human behaviour and all our responsibility. It turns the universe from a meaningless chaos into a designed place in which there is justice and there is hope. Therefore, we all have a duty to discover the nature of that justice and work towards that hope. It alters us all. If we reject it, it alters us all as well. It is incredibly dangerous. That is why so many people turn against it.” <a href=\"https://www.theolatte.com/2021/03/three-reasons-i-believe-in-the-resurrection-of-jesus/\">https://www.theolatte.com/2021/03/three-reasons-i-believe-in-the-resurrection-of-jesus/</a> Accessed 21/03/2025",
