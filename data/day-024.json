  "scripture_text": "A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people\nheard that he had come home. They gathered in such large number that\nthere was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the\nword to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man,\ncarried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because\nof the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging\nthrough it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw\ntheir faith, he said to the paralysed man, \"Son, your sins are\nforgiven.\" Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to\nthemselves, \"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who\ncan forgive sins but God alone?\" Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit\nthat this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to\nthem, \"Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to\nthis paralysed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take\nyour mat and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has\nauthority on earth to forgive sins.\"So he said to the man, \"I tell\nyou, get up, take your mat and go home .\" full view of them all. This\namazed everyone and they praised God saying, \"We have never seen\nanything like this!",
  "devotional": "I wonder how you feel about miracles? You may have a positive response\nto that question, and rightly so. However, if we were to delve a little\ndeeper into Jesus miracles we would discover that they are subversive in\nnature. Jesus did not only bless, heal and set people free through his\nmiracles, but he challenged the status-quo. Some of his miracles were\nlike exploding grenades that brought down the walls established\ntheological structures that had kept the Jewish belief system in place\nfor hundred's of years. In our day people use the phrase 'politically\ncorrect,' well you could say that sometimes the miracles of Jesus were\nperceived as not being 'theologically correct,' They caused offence and\ndisquiet. We have sanitised some of the miracle stories of Jesus, making\nthem into nice, wee, twee stories that make us feel good about\nourselves. Somehow, by default we manage to ignore their subversive,\ndisturbing side, maybe that suits us?\n\nJesus has not changed; through his kingdom, he continues to subvert\neverything this world stands for. Through the lives and ministry of\npeople like us, Jesus wants to be a threat to the oppressive unjust\nsystems that control and destroy people. As Christians we ought to be\nthe biggest threat to sinful systems, and organised religion that are\ndominate our society.\n\nJournalist Peter Hitchens the brother of famous atheist Christphour\nHitchens. was a part of a panel discussion at a large conference. An\naudience member asked, \"What so called dangerous idea would have the\npotential to change the world for the better if implemented?\" After\nanother contributor responded saying his dangerous idea would be\npopulation control with mandatory abortions for pregnant women. When\nPeter was asked this is what he said\n\n\"The most dangerous idea in human history and philosophy remains the\nbelief that Jesus Christ was the Son of God and rose from the dead. And\nthat is the most dangerous idea you will ever encounter,\" he said. When\nasked a follow up question, Peter responded, \"\\[the resurrection of\nJesus\\] alters the whole of human behaviour and all our responsibility.\nIt turns the universe from a meaningless chaos into a designed place in\nwhich there is justice and there is hope. Therefore, we all have a duty\nto discover the nature of that justice and work towards that hope. It\nalters us all. If we reject it, it alters us all as well. It is\nincredibly dangerous. That is why so many people turn against it.\"\n[https://www.theolatte.com/2021/03/three-reasons-i-believe-in-the-resurrection-of-jesus/](https://www.theolatte.com/2021/03/three-reasons-i-believe-in-the-resurrection-of-jesus/)\nAccessed 21/03/2025",
