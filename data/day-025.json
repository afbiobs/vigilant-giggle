  "scripture_text": "A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people\nheard that he had come home. They gathered in such large number that\nthere was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the\nword to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man,\ncarried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because\nof the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging\nthrough it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw\ntheir faith, he said to the paralysed man, \"Son, your sins are\nforgiven.\" Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to\nthemselves, \"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who\ncan forgive sins but God alone?\" Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit\nthat this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to\nthem, \"Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to\nthis paralysed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take\nyour mat and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has\nauthority on earth to forgive sins.\"So he said to the man, \"I tell\nyou, get up, take your mat and go home. He got up, took his mat and\nwalked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they\npraised God saying, \"We have never seen anything like this!",
  "devotional": "Another thing about the miracles of Jesus is that they demonstrated\nwho he was; they were a revelation of his love and power, they showed\nwhat was important to him.\n\nHowever, I think that we believe that it must have been easy for Jesus\nto do miracles, sure he was God and he possessed all power, but we need\nto recognise that for Jesus to do miracles was an expression of\ncourage.\n\nHave you thought of this before, that a lot of Jesus miracles required\ngreat courage? His power and love to do miracles was rooted in the\ncourage of a cruciform life. Jesus understood that the subversive nature\nof his ministry would cause a kick back, it would lead to a negative and\nsometimes death-threatening reaction. The only way he could accept and\nrespond to such reactions was to have a life that was cruciform, a cross\nshaped life that had already been laid down. Maybe in our lives there is\na link between a lack of love and power and a lack of courage? Jesus'\nlife and ministry teach us that the love and power of God was never\nintended to sustain the status-quo.\n\nIf you attended Sunday school as a child, or if you have been around\nchurch for a while you will be familiar with the story of the paralysed\nman being brought to Jesus by four 'friends' and how they were\nresourceful and creative. Unable to get to Jesus, they carried the man\nunto the roof, dug through the clay roof and lowered the man down so\nJesus could heal him. This is a very dramatic story and it is often used\nto encourage people to evangelise. The four men who brought the\nparalysed man are portrayed as an example and an encouragement for us to\nfollow, and do what we can to bring others to Jesus. There is no doubt\nthat we all need to be continually encouraged to be passionately\ninvolved in evangelism, doing what we can to bring people to Jesus.\nHowever, that is not the point of this story, of course it can be used\nin this way, as a secondary application. But it is so easy to focus on\nthe activity of the actions of the four stretcher carriers and miss how\nradical this story really is.\n\nThis story is about Jesus and how he has come to redefine us and how\nwe see our selves and the world we live in.\n\nThis is the first in a series of five controversy stories that are\ntold, in these very early chapters of Mark, how Jesus' authority is\nsuperior to that of the Jewish authorities---and how they reject Jesus'\nauthority. Of the nineteen references to scribes in Mark, all but one\n(12 28-34) place them in opposition to Jesus and his teaching, or in a\nnegative light. It is unlikely that these five stories happened in\nexactly the sequence that Mark reports them. It is more likely that he\ngathered these stories from various places and grouped them together at\nthe beginning of his account of Jesus' ministry. In fact, Mark's first\nchapter is the only one in the Gospel that doesn't reflect some form of\nconflict or controversy arising from Jesus' activity.\n\nThe five stories are arranged in a chiastic structure as follows:\n\n1. Jesus heals the Paralysed man. 2:1-12\n\n2. He calls Levi the tax collector. 2:13-17\n\n3 Jesus discourages fasting while he is on earth. 2:18-22\n\n4. Jesus' disciples pick wheat on the Sabbath. 2:23-28\n\n5. Jesus heals on the Sabbath. Mark 3:1-6.\n\nThese five \"controversial\" stories which highlight this emerging\nopposition.\n\nJesus forgives sin (thereby committing blasphemy). Jesus eats with\nsinners (and thus defiles himself). Jesus feasts rather than fast's\n(contrary to the traditions of the elders). Jesus works on the Sabbath\n(violating the traditions). Jesus heals on the Sabbath (violating the\ntraditions). In each case Jesus crosses boundaries that mark him as an\nagent of change.\n\nAs you read these stories you will notice an increasing level of\nhostility and opposition that Jesus engenders from the Scribes and\nPharisees: first they question in their hearts who Jesus is (Mark 2:6);\nthen they question his disciples (Mark 2:16); and then they confront\nJesus himself (Mark 2:24). By the end they are so incensed that they\nimmediately begin to plan to \"destroy him\" (Mark 3:6) --- and this\nresolve hangs like a chill over the story from here on out.'
