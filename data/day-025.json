  "devotional": "<p><b>‘A f</b><b>ew days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. They gathered in such large number that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralysed man, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“Son, your sins are forgiven.” </span></b><b>Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to this paralysed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”</span></b><b>So he said to the man, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.</span></b><b> He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</b></p>\n<p><b>Another thing about the miracles of Jesus is that they demonstrated who he was; they were a revelation of his love and power, they showed what was important to him. </b></p>\n<p><b>However, I think that we believe that it must have been easy for Jesus to do miracles, sure he was God and he possessed all power, but we need to recognise that for Jesus to do miracles was an expression of courage. </b></p>\n<p><b>Have you thought of this before, that a lot of Jesus miracles required great courage? His power and love to do miracles was rooted in the courage of a cruciform life. Jesus understood that the subversive nature of his ministry would cause a kick back, it would lead to a negative and sometimes death-threatening reaction. The only way he could accept and respond to such reactions was to have a life that was cruciform, a cross shaped life that had already been laid down. Maybe in our lives there is a link between a lack of love and power and a lack of courage?  Jesus’ life and ministry teach us that the love and power of God was never intended to sustain the status-quo.                </b></p>\n<p><b>If you attended Sunday school as a child, or if you have been around church for a while you will be familiar with the story of the paralysed man being brought to Jesus by four ‘friends’ and how they were resourceful and creative.  Unable to get to Jesus, they carried the man unto the roof, dug through the clay roof and lowered the man down so Jesus could heal him. This is a very dramatic story and it is often used to encourage people to evangelise. The four men who brought the paralysed man are portrayed as an example and an encouragement for us to follow, and do what we can to bring others to Jesus. There is no doubt that we all need to be continually encouraged to be passionately involved in evangelism, doing what we can to bring people to Jesus. However, that is not the point of this story, of course it can be used in this way, as a secondary application. But it is so easy to focus on the activity of the actions of the four stretcher carriers and miss how radical this story really is.  </b></p>\n<p><b>This story is about Jesus and how he has come to redefine us and how we see our selves and the world we live in.</b></p>\n<p><b>This is the first in a series of five controversy stories that are told, in these very early chapters of Mark, how Jesus’ authority is superior to that of the Jewish authorities—and how they reject Jesus’ authority. </b><b>Of the nineteen references to scribes in Mark, all but one (12 28-34) place them in opposition to Jesus and his teaching, or in a negative light.  </b><b>It is unlikely that these five stories happened in exactly the sequence that Mark reports them. It is more likely that he gathered these stories from various places and grouped them together at the beginning of his account of Jesus’ ministry. </b><b>In fact, Mark’s first chapter is  the only one in the Gospel that doesn’t reflect some form of conflict or controversy arising from Jesus’ activity. </b></p>\n<p><b>The five stories are arranged in a chiastic structure as follows:</b></p>\n<p><b>1. Jesus heals the Paralysed man. 2:1-12 </b></p>\n<p><b>2. He calls Levi the tax collector. 2:13-17 </b></p>\n<p><b>3 Jesus discourages fasting while he is on earth. 2:18-22</b></p>\n<p><b>4. Jesus’ disciples pick wheat on the Sabbath. 2:23-28</b></p>\n<p><b>5. Jesus heals on the Sabbath. Mark 3:1-6.</b></p>\n<p><b>These five “controversial” stories which highlight this emerging opposition.</b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus forgives sin (thereby committing blasphemy). Jesus eats with sinners (and thus defiles himself). Jesus feasts rather than fast’s (contrary to the traditions of the elders). Jesus works on the Sabbath (violating the traditions). Jesus heals on the Sabbath (violating the traditions). In each case Jesus crosses boundaries that mark him as an agent of change.</b></p>\n<p><b>As you read these stories you will notice an increasing level of hostility and opposition that Jesus engenders from the Scribes and Pharisees: first they question in their hearts who Jesus is (Mark 2:6); then they question his disciples (Mark 2:16); and then they confront Jesus himself (Mark 2:24). By the end they are so incensed that they immediately begin to plan to “destroy him” (Mark 3:6) — and this resolve hangs like a chill over the story from here on out.’ John-Mark Hicks </b><a href=\"https://johnmarkhicks.com/2011/10/06/mark-223-36-son-of-man-sabbath-and-opposition\">https://johnmarkhicks.com/2011/10/06/mark-223-36-son-of-man-sabbath-and-opposition</a><a href=\"https://johnmarkhicks.com/2011/10/06/mark-223-36-son-of-man-sabbath-and-opposition/accessd\">  </a><a href=\"https://johnmarkhicks.com/2011/10/06/mark-223-36-son-of-man-sabbath-and-opposition/accessd\">accessd</a><b> </b><b>24/04/2025.  </b></p>",
