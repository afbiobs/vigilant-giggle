However, if we are given an opportunity to show love or minister to a person in need, then we must not be afraid to stop what we are doing, put our agenda on hold so we can respond to a need that has been brought before us. </b></p>\n<p><b>This story redefines how we understand our needs.</b></p>\n<p><b>Here we have a man who is in great physical need. If you were to asses this man’s need, you would say yes his greatest need is physical. This man can do nothing for himself, he is totally dependant on others. So these men go to a lot of trouble to bring this poor man to Jesus so he can be healed. </b></p>\n<p><b>We live in a world that puts a premium on having our physical needs met. Health and fitness is a big business. The health service is the biggest employer in the UK with 1.3 million staff, the 8</b><b>th</b><b> biggest employer in the world. There is a growing demand for a law to be passed that permits ‘assisted dying,’ for those who live in pain. We all know at at personal level what it like to be sick or live with pain. So we can understand why these men brought the paralysed man to Jesus with the expectation of being healed. But listen to what Jesus says. </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘Son your sins are forgiven</span></b><b>.’ No one expected this. Was Jesus being insensitive or cruel? No, Jesus was dealing with this man greatest need. </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus will never belittle your physical pain, he will never play down a persons suffering or difficult circumstances, but he may not agree with how we may assess our priorities our own needs.</b></p>\n<p><b>‘If you&#x27;re convinced something is a need, you think you&#x27;re entitled to it; you think it&#x27;s your right to demand it; and you will judge the love of others by that. When it comes to need, the Gospel is counter-intuitive. The Gospel is countercultural; it confronts our sense of need.’  Paul Tripp. (source unknown.)</b></p>\n<p><b>Here is a very important point, if Jesus had only ministered to this man at the point of his perceived need the man would have not been really changed. Jesus could have just healed the man physically, but this would not have really changed him. </b></p>\n<p><b>There is something in all of us that doesn’t really want to get too close to Jesus, for if we do, he will ignore our priorities, our wants, our understanding of our needs, and go to the issue of our hearts. We would rather Jesus sort out all the external stuff, heal our bodies, and change our circumstances. Jesus can do that, but there are other things that are much more important. In redefining our needs, Jesus helps us understand who we really are.  </b></p>\n<p><b>In making immediate reference to the paralysed man&#x27;s sin and his need of forgiveness, Jesus was refusing to allow him to hide behind his terrible circumstances, he refused to allow him to be victim, or play the ‘disabled card.’ He was holding him accountable, for his sin, [not his disability] which is why he needed to be forgiven.     </b></p>\n<p><b>I don’t think we are too comfortable with this kind of Jesus, a Jesus who is more concerned about the effect of our sin than our physical health.

However, Jesus loves us too much to allow us to remain living in denial and pretence.  On the surface it appeared to be a ‘not so good bedside manner.’  Only Jesus has the right to treat us in this way, for he alone knows our hearts.</b></p>\n<p><b>One of the things that may stop a person from having a close relationship with Jesus is that they don’t want to face the real issues of their hearts.
