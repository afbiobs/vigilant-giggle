  "scripture_text": "A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people\nheard that he had come home. They gathered in such large number that\nthere was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the\nword to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man,\ncarried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because\nof the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging\nthrough it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw\ntheir faith, he said to the paralysed man, \"Son, your sins are\nforgiven.\" Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to\nthemselves, \"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who\ncan forgive sins but God alone?\" Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit\nthat this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to\nthem, \"Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to\nthis paralysed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take\nyour mat and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has\nauthority on earth to forgive sins.\" So he said to the man, \"I tell\nyou, get up, take your mat and go home. He got up, took his mat and\nwalked out in full view of them all.",
  "devotional": "This amazed everyone and they praised God saying, \"We have never seen\nanything like this!\"\n\nJust at a surface level this story teaches us about living with an\nunfixed agenda.\n\nImagine, here was the Son of God, teaching the word of God, and\nsuddenly he is interrupted. Surely these men could have waited, a few\nmore minutes was not going to make a huge difference. Jesus did not\nallow his own agenda from robbing him of opportunities to show mercy.\nSometimes the interruptions in life reveal what is in our hearts.\n\nIt is good to have objectives and goals, it is good to know where you\nare heading. However, if we are given an opportunity to show love or\nminister to a person in need, then we must not be afraid to stop what we\nare doing, put our agenda on hold so we can respond to a need that has\nbeen brought before us.\n\nThis story redefines how we understand our needs.\n\nHere we have a man who is in great physical need. If you were to asses\nthis man's need, you would say yes his greatest need is physical. This\nman can do nothing for himself, he is totally dependant on others. So\nthese men go to a lot of trouble to bring this poor man to Jesus so he\ncan be healed.\n\nWe live in a world that puts a premium on having our physical needs\nmet. Health and fitness is a big business. The health service is the\nbiggest employer in the UK with 1.3 million staff, the 8^th^ biggest\nemployer in the world. There is a growing demand for a law to be passed\nthat permits 'assisted dying,' for those who live in pain. We all know\nat at personal level what it like to be sick or live with pain. So we\ncan understand why these men brought the paralysed man to Jesus with the\nexpectation of being healed. But listen to what Jesus says. 'Son your\nsins are forgiven.' No one expected this. Was Jesus being insensitive or\ncruel? No, Jesus was dealing with this man greatest need.\n\nJesus will never belittle your physical pain, he will never play down\na persons suffering or difficult circumstances, but he may not agree\nwith how we may assess our priorities our own needs.\n\n'If you're convinced something is a need, you think you're entitled\nto it; you think it's your right to demand it; and you will judge the\nlove of others by that. When it comes to need, the Gospel is\ncounter-intuitive. The Gospel is countercultural; it confronts our sense\nof need.' Paul Tripp. (source unknown.)\n\nHere is a very important point, if Jesus had only ministered to this\nman at the point of his perceived need the man would have not been\nreally changed. Jesus could have just healed the man physically, but\nthis would not have really changed him.\n\nThere is something in all of us that doesn't really want to get too\nclose to Jesus, for if we do, he will ignore our priorities, our wants,\nour understanding of our needs, and go to the issue of our hearts. We\nwould rather Jesus sort out all the external stuff, heal our bodies, and\nchange our circumstances. Jesus can do that, but there are other things\nthat are much more important. In redefining our needs, Jesus helps us\nunderstand who we really are.\n\nIn making immediate reference to the paralysed man's sin and his need\nof forgiveness, Jesus was refusing to allow him to hide behind his\nterrible circumstances, he refused to allow him to be victim, or play\nthe 'disabled card.' He was holding him accountable, for his sin, \\[not\nhis disability\\] which is why he needed to be forgiven.\n\nI don't think we are too comfortable with this kind of Jesus, a Jesus\nwho is more concerned about the effect of our sin than our physical\nhealth. We don't want to be held accountable or take responsibility, we\nwant to pass the blame, we want to be considered as 'irresponsible,'\nnothing is ever our fault. However, Jesus loves us too much to allow us\nto remain living in denial and pretence. On the surface it appeared to\nbe a 'not so good bedside manner.' Only Jesus has the right to treat us\nin this way, for he alone knows our hearts.\n\nOne of the things that may stop a person from having a close\nrelationship with Jesus is that they don't want to face the real issues\nof their hearts. I don't think it is possible to accept Jesus for who he\nis and remain the same. This man comes to Jesus for healing, and he\ndiscovers that Jesus has a different agenda, 'Son your sins are\nforgiven.'",
