  "devotional": "‘A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. They gathered in such large number that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralysed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to this paralysed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So he said to the man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home. He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all.’\n\nThis amazed everyone and they praised God saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”\n\nJust at a surface level this story teaches us about living with an unfixed agenda.\n\nImagine, here was the Son of God, teaching the word of God, and suddenly he is interrupted. Surely these men could have waited, a few more minutes was not going to make a huge difference. Jesus did not allow his own agenda from robbing him of opportunities to show mercy. Sometimes the interruptions in life reveal what is in our hearts.\n\nIt is good to have objectives and goals, it is good to know where you are heading. However, if we are given an opportunity to show love or minister to a person in need, then we must not be afraid to stop what we are doing, put our agenda on hold so we can respond to a need that has been brought before us.\n\nThis story redefines how we understand our needs.\n\nHere we have a man who is in great physical need. If you were to asses this man’s need, you would say yes his greatest need is physical. This man can do nothing for himself, he is totally dependant on others. So these men go to a lot of trouble to bring this poor man to Jesus so he can be healed.\n\nWe live in a world that puts a premium on having our physical needs met. Health and fitness is a big business. The health service is the biggest employer in the UK with 1.3 million staff, the 8<sup>th</sup> biggest employer in the world. There is a growing demand for a law to be passed that permits ‘assisted dying,’ for those who live in pain. We all know at at personal level what it like to be sick or live with pain. So we can understand why these men brought the paralysed man to Jesus with the expectation of being healed. But listen to what Jesus says. ‘Son your sins are forgiven.’ No one expected this. Was Jesus being insensitive or cruel? No, Jesus was dealing with this man greatest need.\n\nJesus will never belittle your physical pain, he will never play down a persons suffering or difficult circumstances, but he may not agree with how we may assess our priorities our own needs.\n\n‘If you're convinced something is a need, you think you're entitled to it; you think it's your right to demand it; and you will judge the love of others by that. When it comes to need, the Gospel is counter-intuitive. The Gospel is countercultural; it confronts our sense of need.’ Paul Tripp. (source unknown.)\n\nHere is a very important point, if Jesus had only ministered to this man at the point of his perceived need the man would have not been really changed. Jesus could have just healed the man physically, but this would not have really changed him.\n\nThere is something in all of us that doesn’t really want to get too close to Jesus, for if we do, he will ignore our priorities, our wants, our understanding of our needs, and go to the issue of our hearts. We would rather Jesus sort out all the external stuff, heal our bodies, and change our circumstances. Jesus can do that, but there are other things that are much more important. In redefining our needs, Jesus helps us understand who we really are.\n\nIn making immediate reference to the paralysed man's sin and his need of forgiveness, Jesus was refusing to allow him to hide behind his terrible circumstances, he refused to allow him to be victim, or play the ‘disabled card.’ He was holding him accountable, for his sin, [not his disability] which is why he needed to be forgiven.\n\nI don’t think we are too comfortable with this kind of Jesus, a Jesus who is more concerned about the effect of our sin than our physical health. We don’t want to be held accountable or take responsibility, we want to pass the blame, we want to be considered as ‘irresponsible,’ nothing is ever our fault. However, Jesus loves us too much to allow us to remain living in denial and pretence. On the surface it appeared to be a ‘not so good bedside manner.’ Only Jesus has the right to treat us in this way, for he alone knows our hearts.\n\nOne of the things that may stop a person from having a close relationship with Jesus is that they don’t want to face the real issues of their hearts. I don’t think it is possible to accept Jesus for who he is and remain the same. This man comes to Jesus for healing, and he discovers that Jesus has a different agenda, ‘Son your sins are forgiven.’",
