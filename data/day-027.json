They gathered in such large number that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralysed man,</b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> “Son, your sins are forgiven.”</span></b><b> Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, “Why does this fellow talk like that?

  "devotional": "<p><b>This story is about Jesus helping us to understand forgiveness.</b></p>\n<p><b>We need to think as these Jews would have thought. The physical healing signified the spiritual healing.  In general, Jewish thinking was that sickness and misfortune were the result of sin.  Perhaps Jewish teachers did not link all ailments to specific sins, but they did understand that in some way such misfortunes were related to God’s favour being removed.  The healing&#x27;s that took place, even the miraculous healing’s of Jesus, indicated that the offences of the persons had been removed and God’s favour restored.</b></p>\n<p><b>So, it would not have been shocking if after Jesus had healed the paralysed man, he then said,</b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> “Your sins are forgiven.”</span></b><b>  Everyone would have understood that he was simply making an observation or giving assurance of what God had evidently done.  What threw everyone off was pronouncing forgiveness before the healing.  Why did he do that?  He did it to make the point that he wasn’t simply pronouncing what he believed God had done for the man or was about to do but that he himself was forgiving the man’s sins.</b></p>\n<p><b>By reversing the order of healing and forgiving, he demonstrated that he was more than a prophet given a word of insight by God, but that he possessed the very divine prerogative to forgive.  The authority to heal signified the authority to forgive.  As Jesus said in verse 10:</b><i><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> </span></b></i><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">But that you may</span></b><i><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> </span></b></i><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins....”</span></b><b>  </b></p>\n<p><b>The words, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘your sins are forgiven,’ </span></b><b>were more than a pronouncement; they were an act performed by one with divine authority to do so.</b></p>\n<p><b>When Jesus sees the paralysed man he says </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘Son you sins are forgiven.’ </span></b><b>At this time there was a strong belief that sickness and disability was either the result of the persons sin or their parents sin. The Rabbi&#x27;s taught a person could sin in the womb before birth, see John 9:1-2. The Scribes had created categories of people for whom they know God doesn’t like – Gentiles, prostitutes, tax collectors, tanners, lepers, shepherds, women who are barren, and people with disabilities and deformities. So when the people saw this Paralytic man, they had him categorised, they saw him as someone who was condemned, someone who deserved to be disabled, someone who was being punished for his sin and that may be one of the reasons why the crowd would not let him in. So Jesus says in front of all the religious leaders, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘Son your sins are forgiven.’</span></b><b> In saying this Jesus was confronting the stereotypical perceptions of illness and disability. </b></p>\n<p><b>These professional theologians knew the hidden implication to which the rest of the crowd were oblivious to. By claiming the ability to forgive sins, Jesus was claiming to be equal to God himself. According to Jewish belief, no man not even a Messiah—would have the authority to forgive sins. In the teaching of the Pharisees, blasphemy was the most evil sin to which any human being could stoop to. No wonder they were both outraged and secretly delighted at the same time. This dangerous new rabbi was trapped by his own words, public words that had been uttered in front of many witnesses.</b><b> </b><b>Judaism had determined that even the promised Messiah could not forgive sins. So, these scribes took Jesus’ assertion as an affront to God’s majesty, if not an implied claim to be God. In the Torah, insulting God’s dignity was the primary basis of blasphemy.</b><b> </b></p>\n<p><b>The word forgiveness is one of those words that is used a lot in Christian circles. But I don’t think we fully grasp it meaning or implications. </b></p>\n<p><b>‘The word &quot;forgive&quot; is the Greek word aphiemi. It means to set free; to let go; to release; to discharge; or to liberate completely. It was used in a secular sense in New Testament times in reference to cancelling a debt or releasing someone from the obligation of a contract, a commitment, or promise. Thus, it means to forfeit any right to hold a person captive to a previous commitment or wrong he has committed. In essence, it is the picture of totally freeing and releasing someone. A modern paraphrase of this Greek word would simply be to let it go! This means you and I don&#x27;t have the privilege of holding people hostage to their past actions if they repent and ask us to forgive them.’ Rick Rener. </b><a href=\"https://renner.org/article/confront-forgive-and-forget/\" target=\"_blank\">https://renner.org/article/confront-forgive-and-forget/</a><b>  access 21/03/2025</b></p>\n<p><b>In the ancient world when a slave was set free after the death of his master sometimes the word aphiemi was used.
