  "scripture_text": "A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people\nheard that he had come home. They gathered in such large number that\nthere was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the\nword to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man,\ncarried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because\nof the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging\nthrough it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw\ntheir faith, he said to the paralysed man, \"Son, your sins are\nforgiven.\" Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to\nthemselves, \"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who\ncan forgive sins but God alone?\" Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit\nthat this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to\nthem, \"Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to\nthis paralysed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take\nyour mat and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has\nauthority on earth to forgive sins.\" So he said to the man, \"I tell\nyou, get up, take your mat and go home. He got up, took his mat and\nwalked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they\npraised God saying, \"We have never seen anything like this!",
  "devotional": "This story is about Jesus helping us to understand forgiveness.\n\nWe need to think as these Jews would have thought. The physical\nhealing signified the spiritual healing. In general, Jewish thinking was\nthat sickness and misfortune were the result of sin. Perhaps Jewish\nteachers did not link all ailments to specific sins, but they did\nunderstand that in some way such misfortunes were related to God's\nfavour being removed. The healing's that took place, even the\nmiraculous healing's of Jesus, indicated that the offences of the\npersons had been removed and God's favour restored.\n\nSo, it would not have been shocking if after Jesus had healed the\nparalysed man, he then said, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" Everyone would\nhave understood that he was simply making an observation or giving\nassurance of what God had evidently done. What threw everyone off was\npronouncing forgiveness before the healing. Why did he do that? He did\nit to make the point that he wasn't simply pronouncing what he believed\nGod had done for the man or was about to do but that he himself was\nforgiving the man's sins.\n\nBy reversing the order of healing and forgiving, he demonstrated that\nhe was more than a prophet given a word of insight by God, but that he\npossessed the very divine prerogative to forgive. The authority to heal\nsignified the authority to forgive. As Jesus said in verse 10: But that\nyou may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive\nsins\\....\"\n\nThe words, 'your sins are forgiven,' were more than a pronouncement;\nthey were an act performed by one with divine authority to do so.\n\nWhen Jesus sees the paralysed man he says 'Son you sins are forgiven.'\nAt this time there was a strong belief that sickness and disability was\neither the result of the persons sin or their parents sin. The Rabbi's\ntaught a person could sin in the womb before birth, see John 9:1-2. The\nScribes had created categories of people for whom they know God doesn't\nlike -- Gentiles, prostitutes, tax collectors, tanners, lepers,\nshepherds, women who are barren, and people with disabilities and\ndeformities. So when the people saw this Paralytic man, they had him\ncategorised, they saw him as someone who was condemned, someone who\ndeserved to be disabled, someone who was being punished for his sin and\nthat may be one of the reasons why the crowd would not let him in. So\nJesus says in front of all the religious leaders, 'Son your sins are\nforgiven.' In saying this Jesus was confronting the stereotypical\nperceptions of illness and disability.\n\nThese professional theologians knew the hidden implication to which\nthe rest of the crowd were oblivious to. By claiming the ability to\nforgive sins, Jesus was claiming to be equal to God himself. According\nto Jewish belief, no man not even a Messiah---would have the authority\nto forgive sins. In the teaching of the Pharisees, blasphemy was the\nmost evil sin to which any human being could stoop to. No wonder they\nwere both outraged and secretly delighted at the same time. This\ndangerous new rabbi was trapped by his own words, public words that had\nbeen uttered in front of many witnesses. Judaism had determined that\neven the promised Messiah could not forgive sins. So, these scribes took\nJesus' assertion as an affront to God's majesty, if not an implied claim\nto be God. In the Torah, insulting God's dignity was the primary basis\nof blasphemy.\n\nThe word forgiveness is one of those words that is used a lot in\nChristian circles. But I don't think we fully grasp it meaning or\nimplications.\n\n'The word \\\"forgive\\\" is the Greek word aphiemi. It means to set free;\nto let go; to release; to discharge; or to liberate completely. It was\nused in a secular sense in New Testament times in reference to\ncancelling a debt or releasing someone from the obligation of a\ncontract, a commitment, or promise. Thus, it means to forfeit any right\nto hold a person captive to a previous commitment or wrong he has\ncommitted. In essence, it is the picture of totally freeing and\nreleasing someone. A modern paraphrase of this Greek word would simply\nbe to let it go! This means you and I don't have the privilege of\nholding people hostage to their past actions if they repent and ask us\nto forgive them.' Rick Rener.\n[https://renner.org/article/confront-forgive-and-forget/](https://renner.org/article/confront-forgive-and-forget/)\naccess 21/03/2025\n\nIn the ancient world when a slave was set free after the death of his\nmaster sometimes the word aphiemi was used. Here is the important thing\nin using this word for forgiveness the focus is not preparing us for\nheaven but transforming how we live now. Forgiveness is about whether or\nnot we live in bondage and enslavement to sin here and now in this\nlife.",
