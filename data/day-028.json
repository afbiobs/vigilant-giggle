  "devotional": "‘A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. They gathered in such large number that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralysed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to this paralysed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So he said to the man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home. He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”\n\nThis story teaches us about how Jesus understood himself.\n\nOne of the titles Jesus used for himself was the title ‘Son of Man.’ 80 times in the gospels Jesus calls himself this title. We know from Luke 5:17 there was a lot of Scribes listening to Jesus. ‘He was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting among the crowd. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem.’ The Scribes listening to Jesus would have understood this claim as a reference to Daniel 7:13-14: - ‘In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. 14 He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshipped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.’\n\nSo the title had two meanings at a surface level, it simply referred to Jesus’ humanity, but it was also a title of exaltation and victory. So when these Scribes hear Jesus calling himself ‘The Son of Man,’ they knew he was taking on a divine title.\n\nMark tells us ‘the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sin.’ The word authority literately means ‘The right to act.’\n\nWhen we hear the word ‘authority,’ most of us have negative feelings, we don’t like being told what to do, we want to be our own boss. However, have you ever thought that the forgiveness sins is one of the ways that Jesus expresses his authority over our lives.\n\nI am not too sure if we can call Jesus Saviour and not bring all of our lives under his authority. Being forgiven means that Jesus has exercises his authority in your life, but it also means that you have submitted your life to his authority.",
  "prayer": "- Father, thank you that being forgiven, is a sign of Jesus’ authority in my life. Help me to submit to His Lordship as I enjoy His forgiveness.",
