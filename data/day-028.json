  "scripture_text": "A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people\nheard that he had come home. They gathered in such large number that\nthere was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the\nword to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man,\ncarried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because\nof the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging\nthrough it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw\ntheir faith, he said to the paralysed man, \"Son, your sins are\nforgiven.\" Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to\nthemselves, \"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who\ncan forgive sins but God alone?\" Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit\nthat this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to\nthem, \"Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to\nthis paralysed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take\nyour mat and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has\nauthority on earth to forgive sins.\" So he said to the man, \"I tell\nyou, get up, take your mat and go home. He got up, took his mat and\nwalked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they\npraised God saying, \"We have never seen anything like this!",
  "devotional": "This story teaches us about how Jesus understood himself.\n\nOne of the titles Jesus used for himself was the title 'Son of Man.'\n80 times in the gospels Jesus calls himself this title. We know from\nLuke 5:17 there was a lot of Scribes listening to Jesus. 'He was\nteaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting among the\ncrowd. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and\nJerusalem.' The Scribes listening to Jesus would have understood this\nclaim as a reference to Daniel 7:13-14: - 'In my vision at night I\nlooked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the\nclouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his\npresence. 14 He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all\nnations and peoples of every language worshipped him. His dominion is an\neverlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one\nthat will never be destroyed.'\n\nSo the title had two meanings at a surface level, it simply referred\nto Jesus' humanity, but it was also a title of exaltation and victory.\nSo when these Scribes hear Jesus calling himself 'The Son of Man,' they\nknew he was taking on a divine title.\n\nMark tells us 'the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sin.'\nThe word authority literately means 'The right to act.'\n\nWhen we hear the word 'authority,' most of us have negative feelings,\nwe don't like being told what to do, we want to be our own boss.\nHowever, have you ever thought that the forgiveness sins is one of the\nways that Jesus expresses his authority over our lives.\n\nI am not too sure if we can call Jesus Saviour and not bring all of\nour lives under his authority. Being forgiven means that Jesus has\nexercises his authority in your life, but it also means that you have\nsubmitted your life to his authority.",
  "prayer": "Father, thank you that being forgiven, is a sign of Jesus'\nauthority in my life. Help me to submit to His Lordship as I enjoy His\nforgiveness.",
