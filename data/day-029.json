They gathered in such large number that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralysed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to this paralysed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So he said to the man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home. He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”\n\nThis story teaches us about the Scandal of Grace.\n\nWhen Jesus said to the paralytic man ‘Son your sins are forgiven’ the many scribes who were there thought that Jesus was guilty of blaspheming. In the teaching of the Pharisees, blasphemy was the most evil sin to which any human being could stoop, and was punishable by death. Being so familiar with story we think the most shocking part is the men vandalising the roof, but it wasn’t. When Jesus said ‘Son your sins are forgiven,’ a theological and social ‘bomb,’ exploded that threatened everything the Scribes believed and taught.\n\na. The Scribes taught that only God could forgive sin,\n\n‘In the Old Testament a priest in the sanctuary could communicate God’s forgiveness when the atoning sacrifice was made. But Leviticus simply says that when the worshipper confessed the sin and made the sacrifice, the sin was forgiven (4:26). It was God who forgave (see also <a href=\"about:blank\">Psalm 32</a>); the priest could only communicate that good word to the genuine penitent after he saw the contrition, the sacrifice, or the restoration to health.’ Allen Ross <a href=\"https://bible.org/seriespage/12-authority-forgive-sins-matthew-91-8\">https://bible.org/seriespage/12-authority-forgive-sins-matthew-91-8</a> accessed 24/04/2025\n\nb. To be receive forgiveness in first-century Judaism, it was necessary to 1) exercise scrupulous behaviour – never do anything “wrong,” 2) go to the ritual purification baths when ceremonially unclean, and 3) participate in the required Temple offerings and sacrifices. Doing these three things made one “right with God” by definition. According to first century Judaism, “forgiveness” is imputed to a person by the religious “system.” Thus to the Pharisees, there could be no real “forgiveness” without the mandated Temple sacrifices and offerings.\n\nSo when Jesus said ‘Son your sins are forgiven’ he was undermining the whole religious system of the time. He was saying, ‘don’t go to the temple, don’t make a sacrifice for your sins. ’ Just go home. Your sins are forgiven. Can you grasp how big this is and it is still the same Jesus’ authority to forgive makes the religious activities we use to get our value and security become completely irrelevant. Being forgiven helps you recognise that religion cannot change or transform you.\n\nI love that in Mark’s account Jesus address the paralysed man as son/child. Think of the tenderness and acceptance behind that word. As we have mentioned to be in such poor physical condition would had been perceived as the consequence of sin. This tender acceptance was very public and a prerequisite to his forgiveness and healing.\n\nLuke records that seeing their faith, He [Jesus] said, “Friend, I forgive your sins.” 5:20 NIV. The use of the word “friend” is particularly striking and should have immediately communicated to this foursome of friends – so far so good! Not only did Jesus not dismiss or chide them, He called the paralysed man a “friend.” Don’t miss the significance of this salutation – a greeting of good will. Jesus’ first priority was to give this unnamed person a new identity. Up to now this paralysed man may have been known around Capernaum as “the cripple.’\n\nHere’s the important point, the forgiveness that Jesus brings into our lives is so radical that it transforms our identity. Forgiveness from sin is not just about having your ‘slate wiped clean;’ rather, it is God dealing with the real issues of the heart so we can be people who really reflect and know Jesus.\n\nWhen Miami native Chris Carrier was ten, a former family employee abducted him, assaulted him, shot him in the head, and left him to die in the Everglades. But Chris survived. In the years that followed, he struggled daily with the insecurity of knowing that his abductor was still at large. Recognizing that staying angry would never change anything, Chris found the strength to move on. Then, some twenty years later, he received a telephone call that changed his life again. It was the police calling to notify him that an elderly man at a local nursing home, David McAllister, had confessed to being his abductor.\n\nChris visited him the following day. He saw how David’s body was ruined by alcoholism and that he was now facing death with only his regrets to keep him company. At the end of their time together, and unable to see, David clasped Chris’s hand and told him he was sorry. As he spoke, something came over Chris like a wave: “Why should anyone have to face death without family, friends, the joy of life – without hope? I couldn’t do anything but offer him my forgiveness and friendship.”\n\nAnd friendship indeed. In the days that followed Chris visited David as often as he could, usually bringing along his wife and their two daughters. They spent hours talking, reading, and even praying together, and as they did, the old man’s hardness gradually melted away. <a href=\"https://www.plough.com/en/topics/culture/holidays/easter-readings/can-we-forgive-like-jesus\">https://www.plough.com/en/topics/culture/holidays/easter-readings/can-we-forgive-like-jesus</a> accessed 26/03/2025",
