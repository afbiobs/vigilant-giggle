  "scripture_text": "A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people\nheard that he had come home. They gathered in such large number that\nthere was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the\nword to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man,\ncarried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because\nof the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging\nthrough it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw\ntheir faith, he said to the paralysed man, \"Son, your sins are\nforgiven.\" Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to\nthemselves, \"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who\ncan forgive sins but God alone?\" Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit\nthat this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to\nthem, \"Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to\nthis paralysed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take\nyour mat and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has\nauthority on earth to forgive sins.\" So he said to the man, \"I tell\nyou, get up, take your mat and go home. He got up, took his mat and\nwalked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they\npraised God saying, \"We have never seen anything like this!",
  "devotional": "This story teaches us about the Scandal of Grace.\n\nWhen Jesus said to the paralytic man 'Son your sins are forgiven' the\nmany scribes who were there thought that Jesus was guilty of\nblaspheming. In the teaching of the Pharisees, blasphemy was the most\nevil sin to which any human being could stoop, and was punishable by\ndeath. Being so familiar with story we think the most shocking part is\nthe men vandalising the roof, but it wasn't. When Jesus said 'Son your\nsins are forgiven,' a theological and social 'bomb,' exploded that\nthreatened everything the Scribes believed and taught.\n\na. The Scribes taught that only God could forgive sin,\n\n'In the Old Testament a priest in the sanctuary could communicate\nGod's forgiveness when the atoning sacrifice was made. But Leviticus\nsimply says that when the worshipper confessed the sin and made the\nsacrifice, the sin was forgiven (4:26). It was God who forgave (see also\n[Psalm 32](about:blank)); the priest could only communicate that good\nword to the genuine penitent after he saw the contrition, the sacrifice,\nor the restoration to health.' Allen Ross\n[https://bible.org/seriespage/12-authority-forgive-sins-matthew-91-8](https://bible.org/seriespage/12-authority-forgive-sins-matthew-91-8)\naccessed 24/04/2025\n\nb. To be receive forgiveness in first-century Judaism, it was\nnecessary to 1) exercise scrupulous behaviour -- never do anything\n\"wrong,\" 2) go to the ritual purification baths when ceremonially\nunclean, and 3) participate in the required Temple offerings and\nsacrifices. Doing these three things made one \"right with God\" by\ndefinition. According to first century Judaism, \"forgiveness\" is imputed\nto a person by the religious \"system.\" Thus to the Pharisees, there\ncould be no real \"forgiveness\" without the mandated Temple sacrifices\nand offerings.\n\nSo when Jesus said 'Son your sins are forgiven' he was undermining the\nwhole religious system of the time. He was saying, 'don't go to the\ntemple, don't make a sacrifice for your sins. ' Just go home. Your sins\nare forgiven. Can you grasp how big this is and it is still the same\nJesus' authority to forgive makes the religious activities we use to get\nour value and security become completely irrelevant. Being forgiven\nhelps you recognise that religion cannot change or transform you.\n\nI love that in Mark's account Jesus address the paralysed man as\nson/child. Think of the tenderness and acceptance behind that word. As\nwe have mentioned to be in such poor physical condition would had been\nperceived as the consequence of sin. This tender acceptance was very\npublic and a prerequisite to his forgiveness and healing.\n\nLuke records that seeing their faith, He \\[Jesus\\] said, \"Friend, I\nforgive your sins.\" 5:20 NIV. The use of the word \"friend\" is\nparticularly striking and should have immediately communicated to this\nfoursome of friends -- so far so good! Not only did Jesus not dismiss or\nchide them, He called the paralysed man a \"friend.\" Don't miss the\nsignificance of this salutation -- a greeting of good will. Jesus' first\npriority was to give this unnamed person a new identity. Up to now this\nparalysed man may have been known around Capernaum as \"the cripple.'\n\nHere's the important point, the forgiveness that Jesus brings into our\nlives is so radical that it transforms our identity. Forgiveness from\nsin is not just about having your 'slate wiped clean;' rather, it is God\ndealing with the real issues of the heart so we can be people who really\nreflect and know Jesus.\n\nWhen Miami native Chris Carrier was ten, a former family employee\nabducted him, assaulted him, shot him in the head, and left him to die\nin the Everglades. But Chris survived. In the years that followed, he\nstruggled daily with the insecurity of knowing that his abductor was\nstill at large. Recognizing that staying angry would never change\nanything, Chris found the strength to move on. Then, some twenty years\nlater, he received a telephone call that changed his life again. It was\nthe police calling to notify him that an elderly man at a local nursing\nhome, David McAllister, had confessed to being his abductor.\n\nChris visited him the following day. He saw how David's body was\nruined by alcoholism and that he was now facing death with only his\nregrets to keep him company. At the end of their time together, and\nunable to see, David clasped Chris's hand and told him he was sorry. As\nhe spoke, something came over Chris like a wave: \"Why should anyone have\nto face death without family, friends, the joy of life -- without hope?\nI couldn't do anything but offer him my forgiveness and friendship.\"\n\nAnd friendship indeed. In the days that followed Chris visited David\nas often as he could, usually bringing along his wife and their two\ndaughters. They spent hours talking, reading, and even praying together,\nand as they did, the old man's hardness gradually melted away.\n[https://www.plough.com/en/topics/culture/holidays/easter-readings/can-we-forgive-like-jesus](https://www.plough.com/en/topics/culture/holidays/easter-readings/can-we-forgive-like-jesus)\naccessed 26/03/2025",
