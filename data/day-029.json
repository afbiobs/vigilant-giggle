They gathered in such large number that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them, then some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralysed man,</b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> “Son, your sins are forgiven.”</span></b><b> Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to this paralysed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” </span></b><b>So he said to the man, </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.</span></b><b> He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</b></p>\n<p><b>This story teaches us about the Scandal of Grace.</b></p>\n<p><b>When Jesus said to the paralytic man </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘Son your sins are forgiven’ </span></b><b>the many scribes who were there thought that Jesus was guilty of blaspheming.

According to first century Judaism, “forgiveness” is imputed to a person by the religious “system.” Thus to the Pharisees, there could be no real “forgiveness” without the mandated Temple sacrifices and offerings.</b></p>\n<p><b>So when Jesus said</b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> ‘Son your sins are forgiven’</span></b><b> he was undermining the whole religious system of the time.
