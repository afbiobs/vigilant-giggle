Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath. Jesus said to the man with the shrivelled hand, “Stand up in front of everyone.”</mark>Then Jesus asked them “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent. He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man,“Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.’\n\nThis again is a very well known story that has been dumbed down by familiarity; we make a mistake of reducing this to an other miraculous event in the life of Jesus, but this was far more than a story about Jesus’ power to heal. This was a conflict or a collision between two ‘world views,’ between two opposing ways of understanding and doing life. It was a conflict between authentic spirituality and religion, between life and death. This is a passage that is a huge confrontation that challenges much of how modern day evangelical Christians think. We are going to learn through this conflict that Jesus will never accept or tolerate a religion that is devoid of mercy.\n\nAs these conflicts unfold, they become more intense and more personal to the point that the Pharisees seek out the Herodians, who they had nothing in common with, to plot how they might kill Jesus.\n\nIn order to help us understand what is going on here let me try set the context.\n\n1. Jesus had just claimed to be Lord of the Sabbath. ‘So the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath.’ Mark 2:28.\n\nTo call himself Lord of the Sabbath Jesus was saying to these Pharisees ‘I am the interpreter of the will of God for this day. You do not rule the Sabbath. You do not set the standards of behaviour for the Sabbath, I do. I interpret God’s will and God’s Word. ‘ John McArthur. <a href=\"https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/41-11/jesus-is-lord-of-the-sabbath-part-1\">https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/41-11/jesus-is-lord-of-the-sabbath-part-1</a> accessed 26/03/2025\n\nThe Pharisees loved the Sabbath. The Jewish Talmud had 24 chapters and about 1500 rules that had to be kept in order to keep the Sabbath holy. McArthur again says:-\n\n‘Now, when Jesus called Himself Lord of the Sabbath, He struck the severest blow at the Pharisaic system. Because the Pharisaic system, the system of works, merit, self-righteousness, achievement, attainment, of spiritual relationship with God through ceremony and ritual and external law-keeping, found its focal point in the Sabbath.’ <a href=\"https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/41-11/jesus-is-lord-of-the-sabbath-part-1\">https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/41-11/jesus-is-lord-of-the-sabbath-part-1</a> accessed 26/03/2025\n\n2. Many people think that this incident of the man with the withered hand was a set up, a trap which the Pharisees engineered in order to catch Jesus. It is possible that the disabled man was brought to the Synagogue with the hope that Jesus would heal him on the Sabbath and so be accused of ‘breaking the law.’",
