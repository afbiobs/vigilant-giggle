He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man,</b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“Stretch out your hand.”</span></b><b> He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.’</b></p>\n<p><b>We know from how this story was written in the Greek, that the man’s disability happened later in life possibly as an accident. There was a legend in the early church that he was a stonemason. We will come back to this.</b></p>\n<p><b>We know from Luke’s account that it was the man’s right hand, Luke 6:6. This is important because, the right hand in scripture is often a symbol of ability, power or strength. So because of this mans disability he was probably denied employment, and therefore financial security; he would have been denied access to the temple in Jerusalem because it would have been believed that his physical condition was a consequence of his sin. The right hand was also considered the clean hand. The left hand was always used to keep the body clean, and to shake hands with your left hand was considered offensive.</b></p>\n<p><b>This is a very unusual miracle for Jesus. In that, usually when Jesus did some miraculous work he did it away from public gaze, but on this occasion he asked the man to stand up in front of every one, he wanted everyone to see what he was about to do.</b></p>\n<p><b>Writing about this incident Dr Ron Charles says: -</b></p>\n<p><b>‘According to historical records, Herod the great, initiated many building projects during his time, including one to enhance the Jewish temple. The temple was a magnificent piece of work. In order to build the temple, Herod hired a project manager called Jeshu Bensee and also 217 of the finest stonemasons that the region had to offer. While the substructure work was still underway, Herod feared that he would die and hence he decided to speed up the building work. The stonemasons were ordered to work round the clock, seven days a week, including the Sabbath. Jeshu Bensee convinced the high priest and religious leaders that this was necessary and would benefit the temple. They gave their approval and all 217 stonemasons worked round the clock to finish their work on the temple. Once that was completed, the Romans wanted to build the Tower of Antonio, the administrative headquarters of the Roman governor in Jerusalem. The Romans also demanded that the stonemasons work around the clock to complete this work in record time. Once again, Jeshu Bensee convinced the high priest to issue a proclamation called the Sabbath of Weeks, which allowed the stonemasons to work on Sabbaths until the work was completed. At long last, the work was done. Jeshu Bensee organized a celebration in honour of the stonemasons who had worked so hard, along with their families. It was a gala time, but at some point in the celebration Jeshu Bensee stood up and spoke to the stonemasons. He told them that they had broken Jewish law by agreeing to work on the Sabbath. They would be forgiven for working on the Sabbath on account of the temple but not for the extra work they did on the Tower. He said that it would have been better for them to refuse and face death, than to break the law. The punishment meted out to the stonemasons and their families was barbaric in order to make an example of them. Their punishment included the crushing of the right hand of all the 217 stonemasons, thereby taking away their livelihood. The eyes of the children and their wives were gouged out. The stonemasons were separated from their families for ever, and they were forced to wear sackcloth and beg at the synagogue. No one spoke to them and they were not allowed to speak to anyone. The high priest told them that God hated them and had rejected and abandoned them forever.’</b></p>\n<p><b>If these facts are true, then Jesus was making a huge statement. He was bringing people like this stonemason out from the edges of society, back into the centre of public worship.      </b></p>",
