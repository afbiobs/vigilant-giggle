  "devotional": "We know from how this story was written in the Greek, that the man's\ndisability happened later in life possibly as an accident. There was a\nlegend in the early church that he was a stonemason. We will come back\nto this.\n\nWe know from Luke's account that it was the man's right hand, Luke\n6:6. This is important because, the right hand in scripture is often a\nsymbol of ability, power or strength. So because of this mans disability\nhe was probably denied employment, and therefore financial security; he\nwould have been denied access to the temple in Jerusalem because it\nwould have been believed that his physical condition was a consequence\nof his sin. The right hand was also considered the clean hand. The left\nhand was always used to keep the body clean, and to shake hands with\nyour left hand was considered offensive.\n\nThis is a very unusual miracle for Jesus. In that, usually when Jesus\ndid some miraculous work he did it away from public gaze, but on this\noccasion he asked the man to stand up in front of every one, he wanted\neveryone to see what he was about to do.\n\nWriting about this incident Dr Ron Charles says: -\n\n'According to historical records, Herod the great, initiated many\nbuilding projects during his time, including one to enhance the Jewish\ntemple. The temple was a magnificent piece of work. In order to build\nthe temple, Herod hired a project manager called Jeshu Bensee and also\n217 of the finest stonemasons that the region had to offer. While the\nsubstructure work was still underway, Herod feared that he would die and\nhence he decided to speed up the building work. The stonemasons were\nordered to work round the clock, seven days a week, including the\nSabbath. Jeshu Bensee convinced the high priest and religious leaders\nthat this was necessary and would benefit the temple. They gave their\napproval and all 217 stonemasons worked round the clock to finish their\nwork on the temple. Once that was completed, the Romans wanted to build\nthe Tower of Antonio, the administrative headquarters of the Roman\ngovernor in Jerusalem. The Romans also demanded that the stonemasons\nwork around the clock to complete this work in record time. Once again,\nJeshu Bensee convinced the high priest to issue a proclamation called\nthe Sabbath of Weeks, which allowed the stonemasons to work on Sabbaths\nuntil the work was completed. At long last, the work was done. Jeshu\nBensee organized a celebration in honour of the stonemasons who had\nworked so hard, along with their families. It was a gala time, but at\nsome point in the celebration Jeshu Bensee stood up and spoke to the\nstonemasons. He told them that they had broken Jewish law by agreeing to\nwork on the Sabbath. They would be forgiven for working on the Sabbath\non account of the temple but not for the extra work they did on the\nTower. He said that it would have been better for them to refuse and\nface death, than to break the law. The punishment meted out to the\nstonemasons and their families was barbaric in order to make an example\nof them. Their punishment included the crushing of the right hand of all\nthe 217 stonemasons, thereby taking away their livelihood. The eyes of\nthe children and their wives were gouged out. The stonemasons were\nseparated from their families for ever, and they were forced to wear\nsackcloth and beg at the synagogue. No one spoke to them and they were\nnot allowed to speak to anyone. The high priest told them that God hated\nthem and had rejected and abandoned them forever.'\n\nIf these facts are true, then Jesus was making a huge statement. He\nwas bringing people like this stonemason out from the edges of society,\nback into the centre of public worship.",
