  "devotional": "<p><b>What can this story teach us?</b></p>\n<p><b>It teaches us that some things make Jesus angry. There are a number of times in the gospels where we see Jesus expressing anger, for example when he turned the tables over in the temple, or when he was at the grave side of Lazarus. But this is the only time that we are explicitly told that Jesus was angry.</b></p>\n<p><b>An ‘angry Jesus,’ is a Jesus we are not too happy with. I read recently about a toy manufacturer who made a ‘Jesus doll’ It was a ‘huggable, washable, talking,’ doll sporting fuzzy dread locks and satiny beard. When you pulled out the string it said things like. ‘I love you.’ ‘I have great plans for you life.’ ‘Be good to your mother and father.’ That is the kind of Jesus we want. We don’t want a ‘Jesus,’ who gets angry, and we certainly don’t want a Jesus who confronts us and shatters how we see and do life. The incident of the healing of the man with the withered hand was a ‘divine wrecking ball,’ that was going to shatter how these religious people understood life.</b></p>\n<p><b>The life of Jesus will cause us to rethink our understanding of anger. For Jesus, anger was an expression of perfect humanity, it was a necessary virtue that was required to ensure the fulfilment of the loving purposes of God. It was an expression of holy living, an excellent manifestation of morality. For Jesus, expressed anger was consistent with his love and grace. It was a refusal to accept the reign of evil, it was a choice to make a difference in situations where cruelty and injustice appeared to have control. </b></p>\n<p><b>Did Jesus not clearly condemn anger? </b></p>\n<p><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“</span></b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’  But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.</span></b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> (Matt 5:21-22).</span></b></p>\n<p><b>Notice that Jesus gives two examples of the kind of anger he means. The first example is to use the term of contempt: </b><b>Raca.</b><b> This term is hard to translate so it is simply rendered in the Aramaic. Essentially what it means is to strip a person of any dignity and to regard them with utter contempt. The term </b><b>fool</b><b>; has a similar, though less egregious, purpose. Hence, it would seem that the Lord is not condemning all anger here but rather the anger of contempt and depersonalisation.</b></p>\n<p><b>The problem is we have taken the virtue of anger and turned it into a vice. Our sin has deformed and distorted the virtue of anger so much, that it has become the means by which we express resentment, revenge and control. We have made it into the </b><b>manifestation</b><b> of acute selfishness, instead of it being a motivating influence against injustice and the suffering of others.</b></p>\n<p><b>Selfishness has the ability to intoxicate and weaponise anger. When anger ceases to be a virtue that causes us to react to the abuse of others, it will become toxic selfishness that will poison us, and a weapon that we will use to destroy others for our own benefit.</b></p>\n<p><b>Sadly the selfless anger that Jesus displayed is rarely seen in the church. I think there are  two reasons for this. </b></p>\n<p><b>Firstly there seems to be a tsunami of apathy, the church does not care enough to </b><b>demonstrate the virtue of selfless anger. It is interesting that the words for disobedience and unbelief in the New Testament come from the Greek word from which we get our English word apathy. </b></p>\n<p><b>Secondly, because we are so accustomed to selfish, toxic anger, we can assume that all anger is wrong.  </b></p>\n<p><b>‘</b><b>Holy anger is not driven by a desire to judge or get even, but by a desire to love people and set them free. Holy anger does not involve screaming for your rights but advocating for the rights of others. Holy anger is not about proving a point but about proving that everyone has value. Holy anger is not about personal gain but about restoring personal dignity to others. Holy anger comes in many forms and is expressed in multiple ways, but the result is always the same: action is taken in the name of Jesus to loosen chains of injustice, restore dignity and rescue people.’ Jamie Snyder     </b></p>\n<p><b>I wonder what causes us to be angry?</b></p>\n<p><b>Tim Keller wrote ‘There’s nothing wrong with being ticked — getting angry to a degree — if somebody slights your reputation, but why are you ten times — </b><b>a hundred times</b><b> — more angry about it than some horrible violent injustice being done to people in another part of the world? Do you know why?  Because if what you’re really looking to for your significance and security is people’s approval or a good reputation or status or something like that, then when anything gets between you and the thing you have to have, you become implacably angry. You have to have it. You’re over the top.
