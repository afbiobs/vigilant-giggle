  "devotional": "<p><b>a. The attitudes of the Scribes and Pharisees.</b></p>\n<p><b>Mark tells us a number of important things about the attitudes of these religious people. As does Luke. Luke 6:8 tells us that ‘Jesus knew what they were thinking.’ </b></p>\n<p><b>What was upsetting Jesus at this time is that they were looking great, they were ticking all the boxes, they were sitting on their usual seats in the Synagogue, but their attitudes was a cause of offence and anger to Jesus. </b></p>\n<p><b>The religious people were highly respected members of society. They had a deep love for the word of God, they could quote whole books of the Old Testament, they were trying to live ‘holy lives,’ but they made Jesus angry. </b></p>\n<p><b>Mark tells us ‘they wanted some reason to accuse Jesus.’ The word accuse is a technical legal term which means to mount a legal case against someone in order to collect evidence against them. It comes from two Greek words  ‘Agora,’ a place of public speaking, prefixed by ‘kata’ meaning against. Hence it means speaking against a person before a public tribunal. It wasn’t that they stumbled on an issue that proved problematical to their understanding, but they were determined to find a reason to publicly accuse, humiliate and embarrass Jesus, so they could control him. They were sitting in judgement, they were hoping that Jesus would incriminate himself. This same word kategoreo is the same word that our English word category from. They wanted to accuse Jesus so they could put him into a category that suited them. When Jesus did not act in ways they thought he should act, they attempt to put Jesus in a box that suited their theology and belief system.  We would never do that! </b></p>\n<p><b>They watched Jesus.</b></p>\n<p><b>When we are told that they ‘watched’ Jesus. A very rare word is used which is found only six times in the New Testament. The word carries the idea of watching with evil intent, with hostility, and suspicion.  Outside the bible this same word was used to describe the process of of observing that the legal demands of the law be fulfilled.   </b></p>\n<p><b>How they watched Jesus was an amazing revelation of their hearts, they were critical and judgemental, hoping that they would have an opportunity to humiliate and correct Jesus.</b></p>\n<p><b>They had hard/stubborn hearts</b></p>\n<p><b>In response to the question </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?”</span></b><b>  the religious leaders remained silent. Their silence was really a revelation of their hearts. This was not a difficult question. Who would want to do evil or kill, especially on the Sabbath. God intended the Sabbath to be a day of rest, a day for blessing a day of doing good. But the malicious silence of these religious people was really a loud declaration about the evil of their hearts.</b></p>\n<p><b>When reading this story, it would be very easy to read the phrase stubborn/hard heart as a throw away statement.  But it needs to be understood as a defining or an identifying status of these religious people. The word for Stubborn/hard is porosis.  </b></p>\n<p><b>William Barclay writes that. </b><b>Porosis comes from poros, which originally meant a stone that was harder than marble. It came to have certain medical uses. It was used for the chalk stone which can form in the joints and completely paralyse action. It was used of the callus that forms where a bone has been broken and re-set, a callus which is harder than the bone itself. Finally the word came to mean the loss of all power of sensation; it described something which had become so hardened, so petrified that it had no power to feel at all.’  </b><a href=\"https://www.sermonindex.net/modules/articles/index.php?view=article&aid=34196\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sermonindex.net/modules/articles/index.php?view=article&amp;aid=34196</a><b>. Accessed 17/06/25</b></p>\n<p><b>The word also suggests a dull mind, someone who had chosen to close their mind and refuse to think differently or see things from a different perspective </b></p>\n<p><b>I think this is probably one of the greatest tragedy&#x27;s of the human heart, to be incapable of feeling sympathy or compassion.

This distress that Jesus was feeling is the key to understanding this passage. The Sabbath was given as an expression of God’s mercy.
