We knew exactly at what time that whistle would blow, and we decided the only way to keep from being so disturbed by the cries was to start singing our hymns.

If some of the screams reached our ears, we’d just sing a little louder until we could hear them no more.

Did the man seek Jesus out? Did he cry out for relief – fall at Jesus’ feet and beg for mercy? Did he even ask to be healed? No. This is the only miracle in Matthew, Mark and Luke that Jesus initiates, without being approached or asked. That is what mercy does, it initiates relevant acts of mercy. Mercy will sacrifice religious traditions for the sake of others. Any life or ministry that is not continually expressing acts of mercy is not really of God, and it breaks the heart of Jesus.</b></p>",
