  "devotional": "<p><b>The importance of a formal or intentional critique of a ministry.</b></p>\n<p><b>Every day of our lives we are being critiqued to a greater or lesser degree. People look at our lives and they come to conclusions, rightly or wrongly. They evaluate us and make value judgements about us. This informal everyday critiquing is not something we go looking for, nor will it cause us to make helpful change in our lives. </b></p>\n<p><b>However, there must be times in our lives when we sit down with people whom we love and trust, and who love and trust us, who will objectively and honestly help us see were we are at.</b></p>\n<p><b>This is not an easy thing to do, and it will require vulnerability and courage; but it will ensure an accountability. Some people who are involved in ministry believing that they are only accountable to God and to nobody else. This almost sounds spiritual, however if a person is not humble enough to be held accountable to others, it is unlikely they will have the right heart attitude that is required so they can be accountable to God. Being accountable does not mean that others have the right to control or manipulate you.</b></p>\n<p><b>Often we think that a ministry should be critiqued if it has failed or is in the process of failing. But no matter where a ministry is at, periodically it requires an in depth scrutiny and examination. </b></p>\n<p><b>In critiquing the ministry of the seventy/seventy two, Jesus dealt with how the outcome of the ministry affected them, not the people they were ministering to. It is important to look at the nuts and bolts of a particular ministry, but the crucial issue as far as Jesus is concerned, is how do our hearts respond to the success/failure of that ministry? It is understandable that we want to use a success/failure metric to evaluate our ministry/service, but that does not seem to be Jesus’ concern. He is concerned about how our ministry/service is effecting us?   </b></p>\n<p><b>The process of critiquing a ministry must take place in the presence of Jesus. If we’re being honest, we often say more to Jesus before we do ministry, while the disciples said more to Jesus after they had finished their ministry. We need to develop the habit of bringing our ministry to Jesus in order to get His perspective.</b></p>\n<p><b>To critique is not a licence to criticise or condemn.  </b><b>Christian counsellor Henry Cloud says that in healthy relationships a minimum of five meaningful encouragements should be shared for every one criticism.</b><b>  </b></p>\n<p><b>Nor is the critiquing an opportunity for someone to manipulate their agenda into a specific situation. Rather it is an opportunity to help others grow, mature and become more like Jesus and better equipped to do what God has called them to do. </b></p>\n<p><b>Could I suggest that the critiquing of our ministry and service should be an automatic, default component of all we do in the service of God. And no ministry is complete without this.  Although critiquing ministry is hard work and time consuming, it is fruitful and worthwhile if it is done as an expression of sincere love and grace. </b></p>\n<p><b>Beware of any church/ministry leader who is not prepared to be held accountable, and who is not prepared to have their service examined. This a dangerous person who is a threat to others.  </b></p>\n<p><b>For many people, serving Jesus has become a joyless experience. Many have shown exemplary faithfulness by persistently being committed to the task they feel God has called them to for many years. Now they feel tired, exhausted by the longevity of their service. Through no fault of their own, their service has now diminished into a joyless habit that runs on auto-pilot. They feel like wells without water. Once they found much joy in their Christian service. Now it feels more like a chore or a burden. Like the older brother in the parable of the prodigal son they may say. </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘all these years I have been slaving for you,’ </span></b><b>Luke 15:29. </b></p>\n<p><b>It was never meant to be this way. God doesn’t want our service to be a source of life for us, but he does want it to bring joy into our lives. Serving God and serving others should always be a reason for joy. However, it is not always easy to discern if we have unintentionally made our service a source of life instead of a reason for joy. </b></p>\n<p><b>The question is, how do we know if we have turned our service into an essential for life?  Here are seven possible indications.  </b></p>\n<p><b>1. We have feelings and thoughts of indispensability, we would never verbally express these feelings our thoughts, But inside we think God really needs me!  That is a lie, God wants us, but He doesn’t need us.</b></p>\n<p><b>2. We think that our service adds value or worth to us as people, that it makes us more important than others. Christian service will never add value to a persons worth.</b></p>\n<p><b>3. We will have an unhealthy fear of loosing our ministry/service. We will be unable to pass the baton or retire, and will be terrified of stepping down.</b></p>\n<p><b>4. We will be convinced that no one can do the job as good as us.</b></p>\n<p><b>5. When serving God becomes a source of life, ministry becomes ‘ego driven’ not ‘Spirit led.</b></p>\n<p><b>6. We will develop an addictive approach to ministry and service. For many, ministry and service has become their drug of choice. They use it in the same way the drug addict uses their drugs, to avoid the pain of reality and to get an emotional high or to help them feel better about themselves.</b></p>\n<p><b>7. In our thinking, our status in life is more tied to our service or ministry position than our character or spirituality.</b></p>",
