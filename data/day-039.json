So when Jesus says ‘rejoice that your name is written in heaven’, he is saying the thing that brings you security and joy is not the fact that you can deliver people from demons, nor is it found in having authority, nor is it found in you having the ability to cope with the pressures of life, rather your identity and joy is found in the fact that your names are written in heaven.</b></p>\n<p><b>In ancient times, cities kept a register of their faithful citizens; so when a man died, his name was removed from the register.
