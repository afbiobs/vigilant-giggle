In some ways we often feel more comfortable with the deity of Jesus than we do with his humanity. We worship and obey Jesus as Lord and King, but do we also admire him deep down as someone who set an example that believers can really follow? Do we believe that Jesus genuinely struggled against the challenges of life just like us? </b></p>\n<p><b>Or did Jesus have access to something extra not readily available to all believers?</b></p>\n<p><b>Was Jesus truly human? </b></p>\n<p><b>Or did he have some kind of Clark Kent kind of power that gave him a supernatural power to cope with the struggles of life?</b></p>\n<p><b>Someone has said.’ “If Jesus is superhuman, then I can admire him, but I do not have to take seriously his call to emulate him. I can never be a superhuman being.</b></p>\n<p><b>We are going to discover that Jesus was the most human person that ever lived. He came to earth to show us His father’s </b><i><b>original </b></i><b>intention for humanity.  In bringing us salvation God wants to restore mankind to the life he had before the fall in the Garden of Eden. Jesus came to earth as the second Adam to shows us what it ‘really’ means to be human. You could say that to become like Jesus is to become ‘more’ or a ‘better’ human, it is to discover God’s original intention for us. Through his humanity and by his redeeming grace, Jesus came to transform our understanding of what it means to be human, of being what God created us to be. </b></p>\n<p><b>Could it be that we struggle with the humanity of Jesus because: - </b></p>\n<p><b>a) We feel that if we think of Jesus as being ‘too’ human, then we are being irreverent, we feel that we are being disrespectful.  </b></p>\n<p><b>As a human being Jesus had the same needs as you and me. Yes he was absolutely sinless, but that does not mean that he never made mistakes, or had accidents. </b></p>\n<p><b>Let me quote you something from a book called </b></p>\n<p><b>The Shack:-  </b></p>\n<p><b>‘</b><b>Mack stood in the bathroom, looking into the mirror while wiping his face dry with a towel. He was searching for some sign of insanity in those eyes staring back at him. Was this real? Of course not, it was impossible. But then... He reached out his hand and slowly touched the mirror. Maybe this was a hallucination being brought on by all his grief and despair. Maybe it was a dream, and he was asleep somewhere, maybe in the shack freezing to death? Maybe...Suddenly, a terrible crash broke into his reverie. It came from the direction of the kitchen, and Mack froze. For a moment there was dead silence, and then unexpectedly, he heard uproarious laughter. Curious, he exited the bathroom and poked his head through the doorway of the kitchen. Mack was shocked at the scene in front of him. It appeared that Jesus had dropped a large bowl of some sort of batter or sauce on the floor, and it was everywhere. It must have landed close to Papa because the lower portion of her skirt and bare feet were covered in the gooey mess. All three were laughing so hard that Mack didn’t think they were breathing. Sarayu said something about humans being clumsy and all three started roaring again. Finally, Jesus brushed past Mack and returned a minute later with a large basin of water and towels.’</b></p>\n<p><b>I realise that the Shack is a fictional story, but it makes a very important point; the humanness of Jesus did not mean that for him life was free from mishaps or accidents. Jesus was completely sinless, but because he lived in a sinful world, everything he did was not ‘perfect’ or ‘successful.’ I realise many will struggle with what is being said here because we equate ‘mistakes’ with ‘sin,’ when they very different.  Jesus knew what it was like to be disappointed, frustrated and angry. He did things that did not always turn out in the way he hoped for. Often in the gospels you hear his frustration and disappointment.  Jesus’ humanity teaches us that doing everything with perfect motives and in a perfect way does not guarantee perfect success or results. </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus had to learn to do things; on his first day in Joseph’s carpenter shop, Jesus did not make a perfect wooden joint or a perfect table or chair, he had to learn his craft, learn from his mistakes because that is what it means to be human. This is the Jesus that God wants us to know and love, as a fellow human being who has shared in our frustrations and disappointments, someone who understands what it’s like to live in an imperfect world.     May I suggest that Jesus was too secure in his relationship with his father to be a perfectionist. </b></p>\n<p><b>Perfectionism is rooted in pride. Because Jesus had a perfect relationship with his Father, and loved his Father with a perfect love, and lived a life of complete submission to his Father’s will, He had no need to be a perfectionist. </b></p>\n<p><b>What do I mean by that? </b></p>\n<p><b>Some of us want to do everything perfectly, and when we don’t, we begin to come down on ourselves and beat ourselves up. Sometimes we do things with pure motives, for the right reasons, as best as we know how, and they end up in failure and disappointment.  Sometimes we are overwhelmed with feelings of failure or even self loathing because our best efforts amount to nothing.  We may have done something, even something for God, and it did not turn out the way we had hoped or expected, we may live in fear of letting others down, or fear of failure, or fear of being thought little of, so we develop a perfectionist attitude that drives us. The modern day psychological term ‘perfectionism,’ is not something that affected Jesus. As our perfect example of humanity, Jesus teaches us that being secure in our relationship with the father keeps us safe from the cruel bondage of perfectionism.  Perfectionism is really an expression of inverted pride. </b></p>\n<p><b>We live in a day were there seems to be a ‘pandemic of perfectionism,’ were there is constant pressure on people to always be the best, to always achieve excellence.  Social media has helped create a world of unrealistic expectations that have dehumanised people to a glossy two dimensional fictional character that has nothing to do with their true selves. I’ll say it again, perfectionism is rooted in pride, and it develops a fear of failure and prevents essential vulnerability.</b></p>\n<p><b>We need to stop here and just think about the importance of vulnerability. It’s not something that we find easy, being vulnerable, it feels like we’re being weak if we let others see our vulnerability. </b></p>\n<p><b>For Jesus vulnerability was the ‘doorway’ by which he entered our humanity, vulnerability made the incarnation possible. He took on the weakness and fragility of a baby, becoming dependant and needy. For God to reveal himself in the complete vulnerability of a baby would have been seen as a blasphemous shock, a scandal to both the Jews and gentiles. They both wanted a strong militaristic god who would come and deliver them, a god who was strong and fierce.</b></p>",
