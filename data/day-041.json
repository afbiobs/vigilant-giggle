A lot of us don’t really like ourselves; we would rather be someone different. And the thought that Jesus is just as human as we are does not sit well with us. So we put Jesus into a different ‘category of humanness.’  We wrongly think, Yes Jesus was human, but he was also God, so to compare the humanity of Jesus with our humanity seems wrong. At its essence the humanity of Jesus is no different to our humanity. As the second Adam, Jesus lived a sinless life, but his sinlessness did not make him less human. The truth is, our sinfulness makes us less human while Jesus’ sinlessness made him more of a human being. Jesus never experienced the ‘dehumanising’ effects of sin.  </b></p>\n<p><b>Could it be that we struggle with the humanity of Jesus is because: -</b></p>\n<p><b>c)We make the mistake of comparing the humanity of Jesus with our humanity; instead it should be the other way round. We should be redefining our humanness in the light of his humanity. We should be looking at the life of Jesus and in doing so, come to a new understanding of what it means for us to be human. If through salvation God wants to restore us to his original intent, then we are going to have to rethink what it really means to be human, and this is what the life of Jesus wants to show us.</b></p>\n<p><b>What did it mean for Jesus to become human?</b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus’ humanity was the result of Him choosing to make himself nothing. </b></p>\n<p><b>Paul tells us ‘Who being in the very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very form of a servant being made in human likeness.’ Philippians 2:6-7. These words of Paul express what Jesus did when he became a baby, and how he chose to live his life as a human.</b></p>\n<p><b>He did not consider equality with God something to be grasped.  ‘Christ being fully God, possessing the very nature of God and being fully equal to God in every respect, did not thereby insist on holding onto all the privileges and benefits of his position of equality with God [the Father]. He did not clutch or grasp his place of equality with the father and all that this brought to him in such a way that He chose the condescension and humiliation of the servant role he was being called to accept. He did not think of his status as something to be clung to or grasped. </b></p>\n<p><b>As a man, Jesus was divested of all self interest; He refused to use his power or glory to gain a reputation. Often when Jesus healed someone he would say something like, “Don’t tell anyone.” He had no interest in making a name for himself. He did not care about his reputation. Because of our sinful habits we have formed over the years, it is our natural inclination to be self protective, to avoid being vulnerable, but in Jesus we see that in emptying himself he became extremely vulnerable. The vulnerability in his humanity was never inconsistent with God’s original intention for mankind. If fact, the vulnerability that Jesus displayed was a natural expression of perfect humanity. For it is through our vulnerabilities we discover our ability to love and care for others.</b></p>\n<p><b>In his birth, Jesus let go of all the power, prestige and position, and became a vulnerable, weak, dependent baby.</b></p>\n<p><b>The birth narrative of the gospels are stories that exalt vulnerability, they teach us that </b><b>being human is tied to our ability to embrace a God ordained vulnerability, that will make </b><b>dependence</b><b> upon him essential and natural. </b></p>\n<p><b>Let me give you some facts about the vulnerabilities around Jesus’ birth.  </b></p>\n<p><b>a. Mary was a teenager who conceived outside marriage. Think of the shame and stigma there must have been for Jesus’ mother, and for Jesus. </b></p>\n<p><b>b. Registering for the census must have been a very painful act, not only because doing so was inconvenient, but because it was a reminder that while God&#x27;s people, Israel, were in the land of promise, they were not free; they were under the rule of a pagan power. A Roman law, made by a pagan potentate, compelled the Israelites to comply.</b></p>\n<p><b>Also physically this was bound to be painful for Mary.
