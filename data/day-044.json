Luke 2:40-52</b></p>\n<p><b>I don’t know if you have thought much about the growth of Jesus? </b></p>\n<p><b>As a human being, Jesus needed to grow in every area of his life. He needed to grow physically, emotionally, spiritually, intellectually and socially. Jesus did not come to earth being complete or mature. He had things to learn, he had to mature and grow, like us all, he was a person in process. We are told in the book of Hebrews, ‘He learned obedience by what he suffered.’ Hebrews 5:8 The problem we have regarding the growth of Jesus is that in our minds we equate sinlessness with perfection. We think, ‘if Jesus was sinless, [and he was,] then surely he did not need to grow emotionally, spiritually, intellectually and socially, because he was perfect, however, in order for him to totally identify with our humanity he needed to become a ‘person in process,’ He needed to know what it was like to develop and change.</b></p>\n<p><b>The growth of Jesus teaches us a lot about our growth, His growth is a template for our growth.</b></p>\n<p><b>We need to ask ourselves important questions. </b></p>\n<p><b>Am I growing as a person? </b></p>\n<p><b>Am I growing in my relationship with God?</b></p>\n<p><b>I think it would be fair to say that the answer to these two questions are connected.
