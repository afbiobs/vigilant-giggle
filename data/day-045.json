This passage has caused a lot of debate, but it is unique because it is the only passage that addresses the growth of Jesus. Being fully human, meant that Jesus needed to grow, to mature and to learn.  In some sense this incident from Jesus&#x27; boyhood helps us see how Jesus became the type of man he was. As a boy he sowed seeds that grew up into manly godliness and maturity.</b></p>\n<p><b>We often rob Jesus of his humanity, we think that he always knew everything, or because he was God manifested in the flesh then he had everything on tap. However, that is not the case. He had to learn how to walk, talk, go to the bathroom, he had to learn how to read and write, he may have got his spellings or maths wrong at times.  He had to learn how to build relationships, to read social cues and customs. As a man he needed to learn how to relate to God as his father.</b></p>\n<p><b>We are told by Luke, &quot;Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover.&quot; All male Jews were required to attend at the Temple three times in the year, at Passover, Pentecost and the Feast of Tabernacles (Ex. 23:14-17). The Mishnah expressly exempts women from the obligation (Haggai 1:1), but some rabbis appear to have thought they should go up and some, of course, did. Attendance at all three festivals was difficult with Jews scattered all over the Roman world and beyond, but many made the effort once a year. It was the custom of Joseph and Mary to go up at Passover, the feast that commemorated the deliverance of the nation from Egypt (Ex. 12).&quot; This was an extremely joyous and exciting time in the life of a Jew; it was the highlight of their religious festivals.</b></p>\n<p><b>Jerusalem would have been crowded. How large the number of worshippers was, may be gathered from Josephus, who records that, when Cestius requested the high-priest to make a census, in order to convince Nero of the importance of Jerusalem and of the Jewish nation, the number of lambs slain was found to be 256,500, which, at the lowest calculation of ten persons to every sacrificial lamb, would give a population of 2,565,000.</b></p>\n<p><b>The 12th year was the final year of preparation for a boy before he entered full participation into the religious life of the synagogue. Up until that time his parents, especially his father, taught him the commandments of the law. However, at the end of the 12th year the child goes through a ceremony by which he formally takes on the yoke of the law and becomes a bar-mitzvah or &quot;son of the commandment.’’ He would then assume all the responsibilities implied in his circumcision. The Mishnah encourages to take a boy to the observance a year or two before he turned thirteen so that he might be prepared (Yoma 8:4), and this may have been what </b><b>happened when Mary, Joseph and Jesus travelled to Jerusalem at this time.</b></p>",
