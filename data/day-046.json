In verse 40 we read </b><b>‘</b><b>And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.’</b><b> Then in verse 52 we read </b><b>‘</b><b>And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.’</b><b>  </b></p>\n<p><b>These two verses look very similar, but they are communicating two very different things.  They use two completely different words for ’grow.’</b></p>\n<p><b>In verse 40 the word Luke uses is </b><b>auxáno which means natural growth, like a baby or a plant growing. The word means movement towards a destination, to go up, mount up, to climb a mountain or a platform. Luke uses the same word in Acts 2:34 where he says, &quot;For David did not ascend to heaven.’  </b></p>\n<p><b>In verse 52 the word Luke uses an other word for ‘growth’ the word is</b><b> prokopto </b><b>which was</b><b> used of an army of pioneer wood cutters which preceded the regular army, cutting a road through an impenetrable forest, thus making possible the advance of the latter into regions where otherwise it could not have gone, the word was also used to describe the lengthening of a bit of metal out by hammering (as a smith forges metals) this is not natural growth but intentional growth.</b></p>\n<p><b>Let’s just say that:- </b></p>\n<p><b>a. We all need these two types of growth in our lives.</b></p>\n<p><b>b. Natural growth is the basis for intentional growth.</b></p>\n<p><b>c. We will never mature and become the people God wants us to be without intentional growth.</b></p>\n<p><b>d. Intentional growth is much more difficult than natural growth</b></p>\n<p><b>e. Natural growth is for those who are young, [in their faith,] while intentional growth is for those who are older.</b></p>\n<p><b>When it comes to our relationship with God we need to exercise the ‘discipline of prokopto;’ we need to embark on the painful process of removing things from our lives so we can enter into a new place in our relationship with God. </b></p>\n<p><b>For Jesus, growth was a demanding painful process which ensured that he was able to cut his way to the cross.</b></p>\n<p><b>It is very easy for any of us to be intentionally unintentional when it comes to us working on our growth and our relationship with God, especially as we get older.
