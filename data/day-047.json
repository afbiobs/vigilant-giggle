Luke 2:41,52    </b></p>\n<p><b>Have you ever thought that Jesus needed grace? </b></p>\n<p><b>We may struggle with the concept that Jesus needed grace just as much as we need grace. Often we fall into the trap of thinking that the only reason why we need grace is because we are sinners, and there is nothing we can do to earn God&#x27;s love. Grace is more an attribute of God than a response to our sin. It is the essence of the fatherhood of God. Grace is the unconditional, and expressed acceptance of someone else despite their national identity, ethnic grouping, cultural traditions, family background, religious preference, social standing, personality, eccentricity or sinful behaviour. We must remember that Jesus was sinless, but being sinless did not make his Father love him any more. His father accepted his sinless life as a substitute for our sinful lives. Jesus always did the things that pleased his father, but Gods love for His son was unconditional. Experiencing the grace of God led to real growth. Because Jesus had no pride in his heart he was responsive to the grace of his Father. Jesus grew because he knew that his father loved him unconditionally. Being secure in his Father’s love made his growth possible. The courage to grow is rooted in knowing we are completely loved. </b></p>\n<p><b>As Jesus enjoyed the love of his father he found the security to ‘prokopto.’</b></p>\n<p><b>2 Peter 3:18 ‘But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.’ </b><b>    </b></p>\n<p><b>We need to prize wisdom above knowledge.</b></p>\n<p><b>When we are told that Jesus grew in wisdom, we must not think that it is referring solely to knowledge or understanding. Wisdom includes knowledge and understanding, but it is a lot more.  Wisdom is allowing the understanding of biblical principles to dominate and govern every area of our lives. It is understanding what God would require in every circumstance. Wisdom is having a spiritual understanding about every area of life. </b><b>I</b><b>t is about truly knowing God and rightly responding to God in love and dependence and obedience!</b><b> </b><b>Wisdom is about making the things of the Father your things. It is the knowledge of how to do the right thing at the right time in the right way, in all circumstances.</b></p>\n<p><b>It can’t be assumed that Jesus brought all his wisdom and knowledge with him simply because he was God. It is also a mistake to assume that wisdom and knowledge was poured into him because of God’s favour upon him. That’s just not the way wisdom works, and it’s not the way it worked in Jesus’ life. One is not simply filled with wisdom. Wisdom is something acquired through effort and experience. I don’t think it is possible to live a God glorifying life without growing in wisdom.</b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus grew in stature.</b></p>\n<p><b>This word for stature can either mean physical height or to grow in age, either way, the idea is, that at times in our lives, growth needs to be evident, visible, and easy to recognise. Think of it in this way, sometimes we find it difficult to discern growth in ourselves, so why not sit down with those who love you and know and ask them, ‘Do you see spiritual growth in me?’   ‘Am I Changing?’ Authentic growth doesn’t remain invisible.</b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus grew in favour with men.</b></p>\n<p><b>This does not mean that Jesus was a people pleaser. Rather it means Jesus had the growth and maturity to relate to others in ways that were meaningful and helpful. His growth in his relationship with his father determined how others related to him and he related to them.</b></p>",
