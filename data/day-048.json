Luke2:41-52</b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus was overtly teachable.</b></p>\n<p><b>Here he was sitting among the religious teachers, listening and asking questions. I understand that here Jesus was only 12 years old and had lots to learn, however, all through his life on earth Jesus was teachable. How do I know that? Because being teachable is a posture of the heart that come from humility. Read John 7:16 NIV  “My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me.’ </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus was focused on his Father.</b></p>\n<p><b>When Mary and Joseph found him in the temple Jesus was surprised. </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘Why were you searching for me</span></b><b>” he asked. “</b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?’</span></b><b> [or about my Father’s business.]’  The way Luke describes how Mary and Joseph searched is referring to their mental attitude. The search was full of doubt and mental agony. It must have been particularly distressing for them to realise that Jesus was missing. It is understandable that they were so wrapped up in their own pain that they could not see that there was nothing wrong with what the boy did in staying at the temple. Their rationale is irrational: because they suffered, they assumed him wrong.</b></p>\n<p><b>It is not that they did not understand Christ&#x27;s statement in an academic sense; it is just that they are so out of fellowship with him that they will not accept his conclusion. To accept his conclusion is to admit they are wrong, and that is just something that they will not do. One or the other of them had to be wrong; it was not Christ. One of the greatest surrenders of pride is to admit that you have caused your own pain; that is what Joseph and Mary are struggling with. Make no mistake the accusation of Joseph and Mary is completely unfair. At this time they didn’t get him or understand him. Despite that, he maintained his focus. Parents will not always get or understand their children and that has to be okay. Sometimes to maintain a spiritual focus can be very difficult and stressful.   </b></p>\n<p><b>When Jesus was growing up as a boy, the people of Israel had developed a wrong concept of God. God was someone who was far away, someone who did not care, someone who hadn&#x27;t spoken to the nation for 400 years. Peoples&#x27; perception of God was that He imposed rules and regulations on them. Judaism had become a legalistic religion with no love or compassion and people were used to living at a distance from Him. Here we have a 12 year old boy calling this God his father, someone close, someone who cared, someone whom he could trust, someone he could relate to, someone who loved him and whom he could love back. Jesus&#x27; view of God as his father was the antithesis to how everyone else saw God. This would have really challenged the Jewish mind-set.</b></p>\n<p><b>Growth is linked to a person&#x27;s experience of God as their father. When we are feeling insecure, and are hounded with a bad self-image we will not grow or mature as people. It is only when we are feeling secure and accepted that we will have the potential for real growth. That is why in the &#x27;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&#x27; Jesus begins by expressing our need to experience God as father.</b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus was deliberately submissive.</b></p>\n<p><b>The NIV tells us in verse 51 ‘Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them.’ </b></p>\n<p><b>The problem is that the word obedient can miss what the text is saying. Someone can be ‘obedient,’ but in their hearts not be submissive, however, it is more difficult to be submissive and not be obedient. The word that Luke uses carries the idea of having an attitude of deep respect and humility. Jesus was free and secure enough that he had no problem with submission. Even though they didn’t understand Him, Jesus was submissive. Jesus was submissive even though he misunderstood.</b></p>\n<p><b>As we have seen, growing in our relationship with God requires intentionality on our part, it is not achieved by default. Like Jesus we need to ‘prokopto’ continually cut from our lives the things that threaten us from growing in our relationship with God.</b></p>",
