The humanity of Jesus not only teaches us what it means to be human, but it also teaches us about the person and work of the Holy Spirit. Before we start, let’s set down some things that will help us in our thinking.</b></p>\n<p><b>1.Jesus lived normally within the confines of his human limitations, relying predominantly on the divine resources of the Father and the Holy Spirit, while using his own divine power infrequently, if at all, and never for his own benefit.</b></p>\n<p><b>As a man Jesus lived the life he lived, not because he had a divine nature but because he was predominantly dependant on the Holy Spirit. As a man he chose to live a life that required the empowering of the Holy Spirit.  In a sermon to the Gentile Cornelius and his household, the apostle Peter offered a summary statement of the ministry of Jesus: “how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him” (Acts 10:38). On occasions Jesus did display aspects of his divine nature, for example when he was transfigured, or when walked on water, or when he forgave sin, for only God can forgive sin; but for the most part, Jesus lived as an ordinary man who had a life that was empowered by the Holy Spirit.</b></p>\n<p><b>The humanity of Jesus teaches us how the Holy Spirit wants to relate to us.</b></p>\n<p><b>In the Old Testament the Holy Spirit came upon people for a specific period of time with a specific purpose. For example when Saul became King he was anointed by the Spirit. We are told, ‘When they came there to the hill, there was a group of prophets to meet him; then the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.’ 1 Samuel 10:10. Then because of Saul&#x27;s’ disobedience we are told. ‘But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and a distressing Spirit from the Lord troubled him!’ 1 Samuel 16:14. (That is why in Psalm 51 David prayed ‘Take not your Holy Spirit from me.’)</b></p>\n<p><b>But in the humanity of Jesus we see that we were created to live a life of dependence on the Father and empowered by the Spirit; a life of continual dependence on the Holy Spirit. We are told in John 3:34 that Jesus had the Spirit in his life without limit, and although Jesus’ experience of the Spirit was greater than ours, that does not mean that Jesus ceases to be our example or prototype of what it means to live as Spirit filled people.</b></p>",
