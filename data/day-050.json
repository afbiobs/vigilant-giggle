However, at His baptism, Jesus had an experience of the Spirit that prepared him for the next stage of his life.

Like those icons; the baby with a halo, the piercing eyes and the imperial upraised hand. Of course, before this he must have had some awareness: the stories of his mother, the events of his birth, his experience in the temple would have shown that he was marked out.
