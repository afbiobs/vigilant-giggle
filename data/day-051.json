If Jesus was going to come through the ordeal of the temptation, the demands of ministry and the horror of the cross then he  needed to know deep within his heart that he was loved by his father. The love of the father, gave Jesus the security and wisdom he needed to discern and display the self sacrificing way of life that he had been called to.</b></p>\n<p><b>Most of the personal issues we face as people are rooted in our lack of understanding our identity as children of God.  Often our hearts are flooded with insecurities, fears and anxieties. We struggle to accept who we are, longing to be someone else. For many Christians ‘Child of God’ is more a title than an experience, it is more of a theological concept than a dynamic reality.  </b></p>\n<p><b>The most important and significant thing about any Christian is that they are a Child of God, this status is more important than their marriage, ministry, vocation, achievements, or any other thing they may value highly. </b></p>\n<p><b>As an authentic human, Jesus teaches us than our humanity has been created to live in God’s love. It is through the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives that we realise the reality of God’s love. Knowing the love of God in our heart brings assurance of our salvation.  </b></p>\n<p><b>When Jesus heard his father declaring his love for him from heaven, what was his father communicating? The word used for love is agapetos which means to be ultimately concerned for the welfare of the one who is loved. It carries the idea of being loved deeply. Often we have a superficial response to the deep love of God. We don’t let it penetrate our lives or marinate our hearts.  At this point in Jesus’ life, He had done no teaching, nor any miracles; he had just lived a quiet life with his family in Nazareth. Yet he was completely loved by his father in heaven. Jesus didn’t need to earn God’s love. </b></p>\n<p><b>When it comes to the love of God, most of us have a difficulty receiving it. We think it is too good to be true. As we consider Jesus’ baptism we discover that Jesus was in a place where he was open to his fathers love, and willing to receive his father’s love. Jesus made a deliberate choice to humble himself, and his humility enabled him to engage with and accept his father love.  As a man Jesus never had to earn his Father’s love, but as a man he needed to learn how to receive it and live in it through humility. </b></p>\n<p><b>Knowledge of God&#x27;s love for us should be our motivation for ministry. We don’t need to earn God’s love, but we do need to receive it, just like Jesus did.</b></p>\n<p><b>We should be reaching out to others because we know that God loves us, our ministry should not be us trying to earn Gods love.</b></p>\n<p><b>The motive and nature of our ministry will depend on how sensitive we are to Gods love for us. As Jesus faced the future with all the pain and problems, he knew that his father loved him. That love would give him enduring strength and perseverance. If we are not continually open and sensitive to the fathers love then there is no way we will survive the demands of Christian life or ministry.</b></p>",
