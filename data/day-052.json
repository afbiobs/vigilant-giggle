Luke 4:1a</b></p>\n<p><b>We often think of being filled with the Spirit as something like filling a cup with water, or pouring liquid into a container. But a better way to look at it is to understand the word to mean fulfil or to make complete. </b></p>\n<p><b>Because Jesus was God, the Holy Spirit was unable to add anything to Him. As God, Jesus was complete, but as a man Jesus needed to be filled or ‘fulfilled,’ by the Spirit. Authentic humanity is made complete by the fulfilling of the Spirit. I love that, maturity and Spiritual growth are the result of being made complete by the Spirit. Up to this point in Jesus’ life, he had done no kind of ministry, he had performed no miracles nor had he taught in any of the synagogues, yet he was full of the Holy Spirit. It was as if the Father was using the activity of the Spirit to develop Jesus in his humanity.  I like the thought that our development, maturity and growth as people is related to us being fulfilled or being made content by the inward work of the Holy Spirit in our lives.  All the purposes of God are fulfilled in our lives by us being fulfilled by the Spirit.</b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus was led by the Spirit. Luke 4:1b. </b></p>\n<p><b>Here we are told that the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness. The word Luke uses is a very gentle word which means to take someone by the hand and lead them gently forward. It was also used to describe the leading of an animal by a rope. </b></p>\n<p><b>There is one thing we can learn from Jesus about our humanity from this word; that is, we need to embrace and joyfully accept the fact that we have been created for a life of submission. This is so exciting and liberating; the realisation that our lives are not about us, or our agendas, but about God. </b></p>\n<p><b>Let me put this way, lack of submission is so curtailing, for it drives a person into the dead-end cul- de- sac of their own horizons, robbing them of the glorious and the unexpected that is found in having a life that is defined by our relationship with God through his Spirit.  </b></p>\n<p><b>It is good to know that the leading of the Spirit in anyone’s life is initiated by the Spirit which means that God decides when we need special guidance or leading.   </b></p>\n<p><b>Often in Christian circles when people talk or think about being led by the Spirit they are usually thinking about ministry, or being led to serve or help others. Now that often happens, however, the primary purpose of the Spirit’s leading is character transformation and making us more like Jesus. For example there might be a circumstances or a situation you feel threatened by, and you have a strong desire to take control, but you hear God saying through His Spirit ‘Stand back; let me deal with this, let me sort this out.’ The standing back that God may ask of us is so he can develop his work of transformation within us. </b></p>",
