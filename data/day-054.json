Sometimes we mistakenly think that it must have been easier for Jesus to resist temptation than it is for us. Jesus was God, he was sinless therefore he must have had more power than we do to resist the temptation of Satan! The problem with this kind of thinking is that Jesus was tempted as a man not as God. James 1:3 tells us that God cannot be tempted. So as a human being Jesus had to face these temptations. </b></p>\n<p><b>So we want to draw out some principles from the temptation of Jesus that will help us understand his humanity and ours. But before we do that let me say a couple of things about the context of this incident, the nature of spiritual warfare, the importance of discipline and address our understanding of temptation.</b></p>\n<p><b>THE CONTEXT.</b></p>\n<p><b>In his book ‘Adopted for Life’, Dr Russell Moore tells the story of how he and his wife adopted two orphans from Russia and brought them to live with him and his family in the USA.  The interesting thing about their story is this; these two boys had to relearn everything.  They had to learn a new language, a new culture, a new education system, they had to get used to different food. They had to learn how to be members of a family; they needed to learn how to receive love and care. This was a total culture shock for them, moving from the known to the unknown, almost as radical as becoming a child of God. </b></p>\n<p><b>Becoming child of God is the, most necessary, most radical and the most exciting experience that a person can ever know.   But like Russian orphans in a strange land, we do not know how to cope, we don’t really understand the differences, the changes, the newness, so we spend a lot of energy trying to hold on to our old way of living. We become addicted to our past, afraid to embrace a new way of living in Jesus. Sometimes who we were dominates who we are now. </b><b>We cannot live the lives that God wants us to live unless we are consciously living as children of God.
