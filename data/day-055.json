Often our hearts are flooded with insecurities, fears and anxieties. As we have said before, we struggle to accept who we are, longing to be someone else. For many Christians ‘Child of God’ is more a title than an experience, it is more of a theological concept than a dynamic reality.  The most important and significant thing about any Christian is that they are a Child of God, this status is more important than their marriage, ministry, vocation, achievements or any other thing they may value highly. </b></p>\n<p><b>The basis of son-ship is knowing that you are truly loved.  His father prepared Jesus for this ordeal, and planned it.  When Jesus was being </b><b>baptised, a voice spoke from Heaven saying “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.” If Jesus was going to come through the ordeal of the temptation then he would need to know deep within his heart that he was loved by his father</b><b>. The love of the father gave Jesus the security and wisdom he needed to discern and refuse the temptations that Satan would put before him. </b><b>As Jesus endured the hunger and desolation of the wilderness he was acutely aware that he was loved.</b></p>\n<p><b>Mark says “At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert.”  </b></p>\n<p><b>Notice that Jesus was loved then he was led. That is the way it needs to be.  It is very easy for any of us to become stressed or anxious about God’s leading in our lives. We wonder what God wants us to do with our lives, we want some divine plan written out in the sky, but it never happens. I think it is far more important to know God’s love than to know God’s plans. And maybe all the stress and anxiety around the whole area of Gods will for our lives is the result of us not having a deep enough experience of His love.</b></p>\n<p><b>God led his son into the wilderness so that he would learn that being a Son was much more important than being a servant. We can only be true servants when we learn to live as Sons. This has always been God’s way. When a person has been called and commissioned by God to be involved in his service, it is very tempting to allow that call to redefine a person. So everything we do, or everything we become is filtered through a grid of service. </b></p>\n<p><b>A requirement of son-ship is that you are continually under the influence and direction of the Holy Spirit.</b></p>",
