When Jesus felt under pressure with his back against the wall, he would know that Spiritual warfare would be initiated not by Satan but by his Father. </b></p>\n<p><b>We need to make a comment about how some people understand the temptation of Jesus in light of his Baptism. Many people see the Temptation of Jesus as a reaction of Satan to what Jesus’ Father said to him when he was baptised. This in turn has lead to some people creating a “cause and effect theology” which says something like. “I must be doing something right because Satan is attacking me.” They believe that the blessing of God makes them more open to Satan’s attacks. This is both dangerous and inconsistent with scripture.</b></p>\n<p><b>Maybe in our thinking, we assume that if some experience has been initiated by God then it is going to feel right, we are going to have a peace about it. However sometimes, real life feels like death. Jesus was never a victim, but He was always the subliminal conqueror who marched into enemy territory to destroy the works of the evil one. By that I mean, that for Jesus, victory did not come through triumphalism but through absolute submission. </b></p>\n<p><b>For the most part the bible teaches that Spiritual warfare is not Satan reacting to God, but God pursuing Satan.</b></p>\n<p><b>Sometimes it is only through Spiritual warfare and </b><b>wrestling with temptations that important spiritual principles come into focus. It seems that God sometimes uses spiritual warfare to heighten our spiritual awareness and to underpin important spiritual truths. For the Christian the battlefield is often the classroom of God.  </b></p>\n<p><b>As Jesus wrestled with Satan in the wilderness there appears to be a deepening in His trust and dependence upon his Father. In the intensity of the battle, Jesus revisited the core spiritual principles that had shaped his life.

During this period in the wilderness Jesus had experienced his father’s discipline.  Deuteronomy 8 was in his mind, Verses 2-5 read.</b></p>\n<p><b>‘</b><b>Remember how the LORD your God led you all the way in the desert these forty years; to humble you and to test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands. He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your fathers had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD. Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years. Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the LORD your God disciplines you.’ Deuteronomy 8:2-3. </b></p>\n<p><b>Were the People of Israel failed in the wilderness, Jesus succeeded.</b></p>\n<p><b>Often when it comes to the whole area of discipline we have muddled thinking. We are inclined to see discipline as a kind of punishment for sin. However in the mind of God, discipline is not a divine reaction to sin, but an aid to growth and maturity. As a son Jesus never sinned, but as a son he required discipline. The word discipline simply means to educate, and to teach. The Greek word for discipline paideia was used to describe &quot;the process of educating man into his true form, the real and genuine human nature.&quot; </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus had a divinely appointed encounter in the wilderness with Satan. Jesus was learning that cost and suffering were part of the life he was called to. His wilderness hunger, loneliness and temptation were consistent with the love and will of his Father.</b></p>",
