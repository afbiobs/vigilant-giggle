It is important that we grasp the relationship between these two words.</b></p>\n<p><b>A. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish the difference between a temptation and a trial. It is not always easy to know if the unpleasant circumstances of our lives are being orchestrated by Satan, or sent by God, or if God is using the activity of Satan to fulfil his purposes?</b></p>\n<p><b>B. The intentions of Satan behind temptation and the intention of God behind testing are the complete opposite. Satan tempts to destroy, while God tests to develop, grow and mature us.</b></p>\n<p><b>C. Sometimes the temptation and the testing come together. The thing Satan wants to use to destroy us is the very same thing God wants to use to develop us. This is what happened to Jesus in the wilderness. It is also how Paul understood his thorn in the flesh. Look at what Paul says. </b></p>\n<p><b>‘</b><b>Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.</b><b> </b><b>Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.’ </b></p>\n<p><b>D. The outcome of the temptation/trial depends on how we respond to the temptation/trial. The attitudes and responses we need to overcome the seductive nature of temptation are similar to the attitudes and responses we need to cope with trials. Both temptation and trials require us to have a growing dependence upon God and an increasing submission to his will.</b></p>\n<p><b>Barbara Brown Taylor wrote “When the world did not end as Jesus himself had said it would, his followers stopped expecting so much from God or from themselves. They hung a wooden cross on the wall and settled back into their more or less comfortable routines, remembering their once passionate devotion to God the way they remembered the other enthusiasms of their youth. Little by little, Christians became devoted to their comforts instead: the soft couch, the flannel sheets, the leg of lamb roasted with rosemary. These things made them feel safe and cared for, if not by God, then by themselves. They decided there was no contradiction between being comfortable and being Christian, and before long it was very hard to pick them out from the population at large. They no longer distinguished themselves by their bold love for one another. They did not get arrested for championing the poor. They blended in. They avoided extremes. They decided to be nice instead of holy, and God moaned out loud.”  </b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redeemerwhitebear.org/pastors-blog/what-is-lent\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.redeemerwhitebear.org/pastors-blog/what-is-lent</a><b> accessed 30/04/2025</b></p>\n<p><b>Are we willing to go to the desert and stay </b><i><b>as long as it takes</b></i><b> for the Spirit to shape our heart, understanding and mission?
