It is so important that we grapple with this issue, because like Jesus we are human and like Jesus we need to take up our cross. I fully understand that for Jesus the cross he carried was much more horrible, horrendous,  significant and important than the ‘crosses,’ we will have ever have to carry, however, like Jesus, our truest humanity is most clearly displayed through a ’cruciform, life, that is a life that is shaped by a cross.</b></p>\n<p><b>To take up your cross is certainly about obedience, devotion and sacrifice, but I think the most important aspect for us about taking up our cross, is that it is Gods way of revealing his heart to the world. </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. </b></p>\n<p><b>a. Gethsemane is ‘holy ground.’ These are probably the most intimate and most intense moments in Jesus’ life.</b></p>\n<p><b>b.  Gethsemane is where we need to engage in a battle to maintain our humanity. Here was an opportunity for Jesus to take things into his own hands, to become king without a cross, to allow his deity to overshadow his humanity.  But instead he entered into an intense battle to maintain his humanity.  In Matthew 26:53 Jesus said.</b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> ‘Don’t you realise that I could ask my Father for thousands of angels to protect us, and he would send them instantly.’</span></b><b> </b></p>\n<p><b>c. Gethsemane is the gateway to a cross shaped life. </b></p>\n<p><b>At some stage in the life of every Christian, there needs to be a Gethsemane moment, a significant crisis of commitment where we decide what kind of relationship we want to have with God. </b></p>\n<p><b>How would you feel if God took your cross from you? If God asked you not to carry your cross any more? These may be a strange questions, however, if it happened, we would be unable to follow Jesus.    </b></p>\n<p><b>At some stage in the life of every Christian, there needs to be a Gethsemane moment where the decision to enter into deeper devotion and absolute surrender to God is made. </b></p>\n<p><b>At some stage in the life of every Christian there needs to be a Gethsemane moment where the most important questions of life are answered. It is in the crisis of Gethsemane that the essence of our lives is revealed. As Jesus suffered in the garden of Gethsemane, his humanity was threatened, would he remain a man who needed to live in submission and surrender to his Father? Or would he choose to be more than human, and refuse submission and surrender?  Gethsemane is where we fight to preserve our humanity and integrity. The crossroads of Gethsemane is where our past can be wasted, our priorities are challenged and our destiny is threatened.</b></p>\n<p><b>  </b><b>Gethsemane is a place of choice. </b></p>\n<p><b>We know from Luke 22:39 that Jesus had visited Gethsemane before, he was familiar with it, but on this occasion Gethsemane was much more than a geographical location. It was a place of massive spiritual significance, a symbol of Jesus’ spiritual choice. It would have been very easy for Jesus to walk away from this garden conflict. He was God, he had the power to protect and defend himself, but as a human he needed to go through the pain of completely surrendering his life to his father, in the knowledge that he would have to give up the control over the consequences of his surrender. Mark tells us that he would be ‘betrayed into the hand of sinners.’</b></p>\n<p><b>There is something in all of us that wants to avoid Gethsemane, we are happy with a ‘functional’ faith, we love God and we are willing to serve, but go to Gethsemane? Where God might ask more than we are willing to give? That scares us, it unsettles us, and like the disciples we sleep, not realising that sleeping in a place of commitment like Gethsemane could lead to denial or betrayal. Our Gethsemane will never be as difficult or painful as Jesus’. However, it is essential.  There are times in all our lives when we need to visit and revisit Gethsemane, where we decide how we want to live for God, and decide if we are prepared to lay down our lives to fulfil the purposes of God. Gethsemane is the difference between a mediocre religion and whole-hearted following.  Gethsemane is the difference between maintenance and maturity.  </b></p>\n<p><b>Gethsemane is not a regular experience, but it will happen at times of crisis and challenge. </b></p>",
