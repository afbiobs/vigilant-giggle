As a man how was he able to cope? Let me say again, we will never experience what Jesus did, but we can learn from him how we can be mature in our devotion and commitment to the Father.</b></p>\n<p><b>We must not allow our emotions to dictate our understanding of the will of God.

By contrast, in Jewish literature when Jews wrote accounts of the deaths of major figures and heroes they did not make them cool and removed like the Greeks; rather, they are shown as hot-blooded and fearless, and they praised God as they are being sliced to pieces by their persecutors. Nothing in either of these traditions—indeed nothing in ancient literature—resembles the portrayal that Mark gives us of Jesus‘ final hours as he faced his death.’ </b><a href=\"https://podscripts.co/podcasts/timothy-keller-sermons-podcast-by-gospel-in-life/the-heart-of-jesus\" target=\"_blank\">https://podscripts.co/podcasts/timothy-keller-sermons-podcast-by-gospel-in-life/the-heart-of-jesus</a><b> accessed 0/04/2025</b></p>\n<p><b>For Jesus, Gethsemane was a place where he went through the processes of dealing with his emotions and anxiety so he could submit to his father. When God asks something from us that is painful and difficult, we need to go to the garden; we need to go to the place where we wrestle with ourselves and with God. Sometimes we can assume that because something is the will of God, there will be a subjective peace about it, it will sit well with us emotionally. Sometimes that is the case, but not always.  Sometimes the will of God for our lives will cause us great emotional distress. In order to maintain our integrity as children of God by refusing to take things into our own hands we must subject our emotions to his will. </b></p>\n<p><b>The cross God wants us to carry is often sacrificed on the alter of our emotions, we allow fear and anxiety to determine the measure of our devotion and obedience.
