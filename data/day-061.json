He had left the crowded city and come to a remote area outside its walls. Eight of his disciples stayed at the entrance of the Garden while Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him further. Finally, even these three were left behind, about a stone’s throw away and Jesus was alone. [Being ‘a stones throw away’ is very telling because often ‘sinners’ were stoned to death,  Jesus was taking our place.]  </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus needed to create a sacred space, a place of intense isolation, a place where he could pour out his crushed soul before his Father. In his aloneness he pierced the darkness with ‘loud cries.’ See Hebrews 5:7.  The weight he was carrying in his heart was so heavy that he was unable to remain standing.</b></p>\n<p><b>There will be times in our lives that we will only able to deal honestly with God and with ourselves in deliberate isolation. There will be times when we need to choose to withdraw from everything and everyone so we can engage in the painful act of being absolutely real and honest before God. There will be times when we need to create a ‘sacred space,’ a place where all other voices are quiet, where all external distractions are removed, and we feel free to bring to God our hearts.  For some this is a scary place to be, alone with God, dealing with the content of our hearts.  It is this kind of brutal honesty that strips us and enables us to take up our cross.</b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus dealt with the issues that threatened God’s purposes for his life through prayer. The more I have thought about this passage, the more I am beginning to realise that prayer is much more than making requests to God, it may include that, even here in the Garden Jesus was making requests. However, prayer is engaging in a process that will bring about change in us. It is the act of realigning our will with God’s will. It is through prayer that we come to a measure of acceptance. As Jesus prayed he became more accepting of the will of His father and his death.</b></p>",
