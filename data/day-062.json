He begins with the word </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">Abba.</span></b><b>  This is the only time the word Abba is found in the gospels. And it is the only time we find it used in a prayer by Jesus. Many of us have been brought up being taught that Abba was an Aramaic word meaning daddy. However, Abba was not merely a word used by young children. It was also the word that Jewish children used for their parents after they were fully grown. Abba was a mature, yet affectionate way for adults to speak to their fathers. </b></p>\n<p><b>Abba is profoundly respectful; it was used for the deferential language of the Servant reporting to His God, yet at the same time it is deeply intimate, in a way that only a loved child could have used about a loving father. Respect and familiarity seem to come together in the word Abba. </b></p>\n<p><b>In the patriarchal societies of antiquity, the father figure is endowed with two particular characteristics. On the one hand, the father rules as head of the household and is the person to whom most respect is due, having absolute authority over his family. On the other hand, he has the responsibility of guarding, supporting and helping the other family members. </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus’ use of the word Abba is extremely significant, for it communicates Jesus’ perception of his Father. Jesus refused to allow this heart-breaking experience to alter his perception of his Father. In the agony of his heart he still had a deep love and respect for his father. So the ‘Abba’ word tells us how Jesus is approaching this time of prayer.</b></p>\n<p><b>In this prayer Jesus was honest. </b></p>\n<p><b>As a man, Jesus did not want to die a death which was the result of the wrath of God upon the sin of the world. </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus referred to the Cross as the &quot;hour&quot; and the &quot;cup.&quot; The first expression,’hour’ includes everything involved in the Cross. The &quot;cup&quot; figuratively spoke of God&#x27;s judgment at the Cross.  Yet for Jesus, His desire to obey his father was greater than his desire to avoid the cross.</b></p>\n<p><b>This was also a prayer of submission. </b></p>\n<p><b>Submission is not about gritting your teeth and clenching your fists. It is not about determination, and being strong minded. Rather, submission is the consequences of allowing God to change your heart; it is the natural result of authentic fellowship with God. The word the bible uses for submit/submission was a military term; to arrange in order file/rank, to come under the authority of another.</b></p>\n<p><b>One of the fascinating things that comes out of this incident, is that we can see Jesus struggle with God’s plan for His life. It took a painful process with Him wrestling with God before He was able to fully submit to the authority of the Father. </b></p>",
