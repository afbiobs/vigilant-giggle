His circumstances hadn’t improved, in fact they were going to get a whole lot worse, but Jesus had submitted to the Father and was ready to do His will. </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus advanced rather than retreated and accepted the cup from his Father’s hands and from the hand of sinners.  </b></p>\n<p><b>Mark’s account of Jesus’ words and actions demonstrated that Jesus was not forced into suffering and death but actively and obediently laid down his life.  It is Jesus who affirms and initiates this final confrontation.  His command to His disciples to </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> “Rise, let us be going”</span></b><b> is similar to a military commander ordering his troops forward into battle. </b></p>\n<p><b>It is a long journey through the garden of Gethsemane. It is an emotional roller coaster. It is a place where real spiritual work is done, where priorities are established, where we wrestle to accept the will of God. It is a place where we find the courage and strength to keep going; it is a place where we have an opportunity to show God the full extent of our love for him. It is the place where we hold on to our humanity, and choose to take up our cross so we can live a cross-shaped life that reveals the essence of the heart of God. It is from this place that we ‘take up’ our cross.</b></p>\n<p><b>When Jesus said </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">&#x27;Take up your cross and follow me,&#x27;</span></b><b> what did he mean?  For many the phrase ‘Take up your cross,’ has become a cliché which has been robbed of understanding and power. </b></p>\n<p><b>What did Jesus mean when he said  </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">‘</span></b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\"> Whoever does not carry their cross and follow me, cannot be my disciple.’ </span></b><b>Luke 14:27. </b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus was very emphatic here, he did not give any wriggle room.</b></p>\n<p><b>Let me make a few observations</b></p>\n<p><b>Depending on what version of the bible you read, the phrase &#x27;take up your cross&#x27; is either found five or six times. Matthew 10:38, 16:24, Mark 8:34, Luke 9:23,  and Luke 14:27. Many of the older translations include the phrase in Mark 10:21 as part of Jesus’ response to the Rich Young Ruler, while the more modern translations don&#x27;t. </b></p>\n<p><b>There is an intrinsic link between the cross of Christ and the cross we are told we must carry. On a number of occasions when Jesus predicted his death he went on to speak about the cross we must carry. Matthew 16:21 ‘</b><b>From then on Jesus began to tell his disciples plainly that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem, and that he would suffer many terrible things at the hands of the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He would be killed, but on the third day he would be raised from the dead.</b><b>  Then in verse 24 we read  ‘Then Jesus said to his disciples,  </b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">“If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross, and follow me.</span></b><b><span class=\"red-text\" style=\"color:red;\">’</span></b><b> see also Mark 8:31-3 and Luke 9:21-23.</b></p>\n<p><b>The importance of this cannot be overstated. In the thinking of Jesus, the link between the cross he died on and the cross we have to carry is essential for our understanding of who Jesus is. The cross we have to carry enables us to identify with Jesus and understand how he viewed life and how it should be lived. We need to remember that Jesus did ‘not’ lay down his life on the cross, but that he took up his cross because he had always lived a ‘laid down,’ life. In taking up our cross we are entering into the fellowship of his suffering. </b><b>If you look carefully at every context in which Jesus uses the phrase, ‘take up your cross,’  it is in the context of difficult relationships. (see Matthew 10: 34-38, Luke 14:27,Matthew 16:24, Mark 8:34 and Luke 9:23)</b></p>\n<p><b>When we think of Jesus taking up his own cross, that was to mend broken relationships between God and man, so as we try to understand what &#x27;taking up your cross really means, we need to keep in mind the contexts in which Jesus spoke this command.  Taking up our cross has no redemptive power as far as sin is concerned, however, those who take up their cross will be more equipped to build, sustain and heal relationships. This does not mean that relationships will be easy or that they will always be repaired, but we will have the ability and capacity to pay the cost that healthy relationships require. </b></p>\n<p><b>Taking up you cross is how we overcome the powers of darkness.  Matthew 16 places the command to ‘take up your cross’ in the context of rebuking Satan and his influence on Peter. </b><b>Jesus turned and said to Peter, </b><b>“</b><b>Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.’</b><b> Taking up our cross means that we are choosing to live a life that is diametrically opposed to all that Satan thinks and does.</b></p>\n<p><b>In taking up our cross, this is how God reveals the essence of His heart to a needy world. The crosses we are to carry should be tangible symbols of God love for the world. Or to put it an other way,  it is not possible to carry your cross and not be loving, forgiving and gracious.</b></p>\n<p><b>So what is the cross we have to carry?</b></p>\n<p><b>As we have previously said we must not turn the cross that Jesus was speaking of here into something it isn&#x27;t. Many people think that a cross is any trial or hardship you are going through, such as, a health problem, a disability, bereavement, or being single. &#x27;Its the cross I have to bear!&#x27; we say, but this is not what Jesus meant. The </b><b>problem with this understanding is that most of the pain we go through in life is not of our own choosing. I didn&#x27;t wake up one morning and think Cerebral Palsy is the cross for me, so l chose my disability. No! </b><b>When it comes to most of the trials and difficulties in life, we don&#x27;t have a choice, but when it comes to taking up our cross we do have a choice.  The cross in Jesus&#x27; day was an instrument of torture and execution, pure and simple. There wasn&#x27;t any figurative use of &#x27;cross&#x27; as a &#x27;burden&#x27; or &#x27;trial&#x27; in those days.</b></p>\n<p><b>Taking up our cross is us choosing to live the way Jesus died.\nThe cross that Jesus is speaking about may not lead to physical death, in fact there may not be anything physical to it. What Jesus is referring </b><b>to is the heart attitude of a cross bearer. Or to put it in the form of a question;</b></p>\n<p><b>What kind of heart attitude did Jesus display as he carried His cross? Jesus was expressing an attitude of love, forgiveness, humility and </b><b>submission as he bowed to, and suffered in the will of God. The attitudes and motives Jesus needed to die on the cross, are the same attitudes and motives we need for life.</b></p>",
