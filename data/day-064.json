Denying yourself is an </b><b>expression of security not insecurity, it is a volitional choice of our wills, not an emotional response to the world around us. When we fall into the trap of equating a low self-image with self-denial we are doing the complete opposite to what we think we are doing. People who suffer </b><b>from chronic self-image problems can become self-obsessed and  self-centred, which in turns prevents self-denial.</b></p>\n<p><b>The Greek word for deny is arneomai means, disown, renounce, refuse, not to accept, to reject, to refuse something offered, it carries the idea of </b><b>making a volitional choice.
