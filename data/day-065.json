Nor did his death, burial and resurrection make him more human, or less human. From his birth, to this present day Jesus was and is completely human. However, in his humanity, Jesus, through his experience of death, burial and resurrection is able to teach us things about our humanity that he was unable to teach us before his death and resurrection. Or to put it another way, one of the lessons the resurrection of Jesus teaches us, is what it means to live as healthy human being, in the victory of God in a sinful fallen world. </b></p>\n<p><b>What does it mean to live in the ‘power of the resurrection? </b></p>\n<p><b>How does God want to display his power and glory through our humanity? </b></p>\n<p><b>What does the power that raised Jesus from the dead look like in everyday life?  The resurrected life of Jesus as it is portrayed in the gospels, explains and demonstrates the purpose and power of the cross. You could say that the record of Jesus’ life between his resurrection and ascension is an example for those whose lives have been transformed by his death on the cross.  </b></p>\n<p><b>John records more resurrection appearances than any other gospel writer. When John speaks about Jesus ‘appearing’ to his disciples he uses the word phaneroo which means ‘appeared’. This term conveys the showing of one’s character, motivations or intentions, and it comes from the verb phainō, which means “to shine.”</b></p>\n<p><b>Jesus’ resurrection teaches us that mankind has a new way to relate to God.</b></p>\n<p><b>When Jesus was raised from the dead the whole belief system of the disciples was challenged, and made completely obsolete. The followers of Jesus had been brought up good Jews who went to the temple in Jerusalem at least three times a year to make sacrifices for sin. For the early followers of Jesus, the temple and the sacrificial system was the centre of their lives. </b></p>\n<p><b>Now Jesus had risen from the dead, he had become the sacrifice for sin; he was the Lamb of God that took away the sin of the world. </b></p>\n<p><b>Can you imagine how difficult this must have been for the first disciples? The beliefs that their nation had held for thousands of years had now been done away with. And the only way mankind could relate to God was by receiving God’s mercy and grace. </b></p>\n<p><b>Unintentionally for many people today, their Christian experience has become an expression of bloodless sacrificing where they attempt to appease God and win his approval. We all understand the dangers of a ‘prosperity gospel,’ were people are deceived into making sacrifices in order to get something back.  If you were to boil the tenets of the prosperity gospel down to their basic components you will discover that any one of us can live our lives and relate to God on the same premise. </b></p>\n<p><b>Let me illustrate. Someone lives for God the best they know how, they cross all the t’s and dot all the i’s. That person may be tempted to think, ‘I have done my best to live for God, God owes me, I deserve God’s blessing.’ We may never actually say those words out loud, but at times we can think or feel that way.</b></p>\n<p><b>To experience the power of the resurrection is to understand that I can never appease God, and I need to accept the fact that God will only deal with me on the basis of grace. The resurrection of Jesus shouts to the world that the sacrificial system is over and no matter how good I am or how much I sacrifice; God will still owe me nothing, but he chooses to show me grace.</b></p>",
