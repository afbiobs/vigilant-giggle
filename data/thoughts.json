He came before\nJesus, fell at his feet pleading that Jesus would come and heal her.\nJesus went with him along with a crowd who surrounded Jesus. The idea\nbehind the Greek word for surround is to crush or press against. It\ncomes from the Greek word for choke/strangle, so this a very intense\nmoment. Jairus and the crowd are making their way to his home. Lots\nof people are pressing against Jesus, invading his personal space.\nSuddenly this woman touches the fringe of Jesus\u2019 robe, and\neverything stops. Before we pick up the story let\u2019s take a look at\nthis woman.</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nWe know that she had an \u2018issue of blood\u2019 for 12 years. We can\nonly speculate as to the reason why she was bleeding.  This may most\nlikely refers to a chronic vaginal or uterine haemorrhage. We also\nknow from Mark\u2019s account that \u2018She had suffered a great deal from\nmany doctors and over the years she had spent everything she had to\npay them, but she had got no better. In fact, she had gotten worse.\u2019\nMark 5:26. These doctors would have given her \u2018Contemporary\nremedies which included wine mixed with rubber, alum, and crocuses.\u2019\n(D. Bock, Luke [BECNT], 1:793).We also know that because of her\ncondition she would have been constantly living with acute shame, as\nshe would have been viewed as unclean.</strong></p><p><strong>a.\nThe Levitical law stated that during a women\u2019s menstrual period she\nwas not permitted to go to the place of worship. See Leviticus\n15:19-28. The law in Leviticus was very straight forward setting out\nwhat was required. It is not easy to understand why God gave this\nlaw. However, by the time of Jesus, the Rabbi's had introduced a\nwhole new set of laws that would make life impossible for any woman\nwith this chronic condition.</strong></p><p><strong>b.\nIf a new mother haemorrhaged for more than seven days after giving\nbirth she was put into isolation. If the haemorrhaging continued for\na further seven days, her baby was taken from her. A nurse chosen by\nthe priest would look after the baby until the mother was pronounced\nclean.</strong></p><p><strong>c.\nIf the haemorrhaging continued for more than 14 days, she was put\ninto isolation for 40 days, if the problem continued after that she\nwas isolated 120 days. If the problem continued, she was put into\npermanent isolation reporting to the priest once a year. </strong></p><p><strong>This\npoor woman had been bleeding for 12 years, so she would\u2019ve been\nconsidered cursed by God and unworthy of healing. At this point she\nwas officially pronounced dead. Her name would have been removed from\nthe rolls of the living.</strong></p><p><strong>d.\nThis meant that she would have had to beg for food, and anyone she\ntouched would have been declared unclean for 21 days. If she touched\na religious leader, she could had been flogged on the spot [Roman\nauthorities permitting.] Or she would have been banished to live at\nGehenna, a rubbish dump outside Jerusalem. The rabbi\u2019s taught, that\nif a religious leader did not punish a woman who touched him while\nshe was haemorrhaging, he would inherit her curse.</strong></p><p><strong>e.\nBecause she was considered dead this meant that she would have been\ndisowned and despised by all of society. This dear lady was living a\nterrible life. She was the \u2018walking dead.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>Prayer:</strong> Father</p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Genesis 4-7</p>",

You matter and your story is important.</strong></p><p><strong>I\nlove the fact that Jesus did not take her aside so she could tell him\nabout her story and healing.

    "html": "<p><strong>I\nwould like us to consider one of the best-known stories in the bible.\nThe story of how Peter and Jesus walked on the water.  </strong></p><p><strong>For\nmany, this well-known story has come to mean something like this.\n\u2018Peter had the right idea, getting out of the boat and quite\nliterally stepping out in faith. Indeed, in all our lives we can see\nJesus standing out on the stormy waters of life bidding us to \u201ccome\nunto him.\u201d  Like Peter we need this invitation, find the courage of\nfaith needed to swing our legs over the boat\u2019s side and then step\nout onto the waters.  If we do, then we too will walk with Jesus,\ntrusting him alone to help us do great things for God.  But beware of\ndoubts and fears! Don\u2019t pay any attention to the winds that howl or\nthe waves that lap against your shins. Keep your eyes fixed on the\nMaster, for if you do, then in his loving confident gaze you will\nfind the strength and courage you need to stay upright.  Peter failed\nto have enough faith, he sank, but you can do better!\u2019  </strong></p><p><strong>Question:\nIs this a legitimate and helpful application of this story? Are we\nbeing encouraged to be like Peter, to step out of the security of our\nboats and join Jesus on the stormy waters?</strong></p><p><strong>Could\nit be that this way of applying this story is very dangerous for a\nnumber of reasons?

However, often the way this story is taught and applied,\nall it does is appeals to our ego. We all want a theology that\nstrokes our ego. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nthink, if I could walk on water. If I could show the world how\nwonderful and special I am. If God were to really use me in obvious\nand significant ways then I would feel a lot better about myself. My\nego always wants to walk on water.</strong></p><p><strong>b.\nIt could produce a performance based mindset. </strong></p><p><strong>To\napply the story of Peter walking on water as an example of courageous\nfaith, is to make ourselves the centre of our story. We become the\nfocus, and the life of faith, or any ministry we may have becomes\nabout meeting our needs, not the needs of others.</strong></p><p><strong>An\nego-centric philosophy of life or ministry is not consistent with how\nJesus viewed life or ministry. Jesus often told people, \u2018don\u2019t\ntell anyone about this.\u2019 for example See Mark 1:44. 7:36. </strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe look at the life and ministry of Jesus you will notice that for\nJesus the healing of the individual was more important than his\nreputation.

But I don\u2019t think many of us\nwould have come up with the same answer as Jesus. When you read the\nNLT translation of 18:1 you could think Jesus is saying something\nlike, \u2018you should always pray and never give up praying.,\u2019 I am\nsure Jesus\u2019 words may infer that, but that is not what he is\nsaying. He is saying \u2018incorporate prayer into every area of your\nlife so you won\u2019t grow weary, grow faint, loose heart and become\noverwhelmed with discouragement. Or to put it another way. Through\nprayer let your relationship with God be an integral part of every\narea of your life so you won\u2019t be overwhelmed by the challenges of\nlife.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to keep in mind the context of the parable. Jesus had just\ntaught about the coming kingdom. We do not know when Jesus will\nreturn to bring justice to his world. How long will it be? So how do\nwe handle all the injustice we see all around us? How do we keep\ngoing and not give up?</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword used for give up is the Greek word egkakeo, which means to not\ngrow weary or lose heart, which in essence is really a \"positive\"\nadmonition to keep on keeping on, to endure, to persevere despite\nobstacles, setbacks and adversaries.  But the word has a second\nmeaning. It was used to describe the act of committing culpable\nneglect, or doing ill. Perhaps there can be a strong correlation\nbetween these two meanings, we give up and others suffer.</strong></p><p><strong>Martin\nLuther said, \u2018Prayer is the most important thing in my life. If I\nshould neglect prayer for a single day, I should lose a great deal of\nthe fire of faith.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>The\ngreatest motivation for prayer, is God himself.</strong></p><p><strong>Often\nwhen you read the parables of Jesus it can be difficult to grasp what\nhe is saying. We know that the purpose of this parable was to\nredefine our understanding of prayer. But the question, is how does\nit do that?  We can be sure that Jesus is not telling us that if we\npray to God in the same way this widow, who wore this judge down with\nrepeatedly pestering him, then God will answer us. That doesn\u2019t\nmean that we should not be persistent in prayer. But the point of\nthis parable is to show us how unlike God is to this unjust judge.\nJesus is showing us a contrast between God and the unjust judge. This\nunjust judge answered this widows cry for justice, merely to shut her\nup, to get her off his back, he did it to get a quiet life. If a\ngodless uncaring judge was prepared to give this widow what she\nneeded, how much more will a loving God do. A God who cares for his\nchosen people who cry to him day and night.</strong></p><p><strong>It\ncan be very easy for anyone of us to become like this poor widow. She\nwas destitute with no one to fight her corner. Her lack of confidence\nin the unjust judge fuelled her desperation. The more he resisted her\ncry for help the more desperate she became, Like the widow we to can\nallow a lack of confidence in God to produce in us an exhausting\nfeeling of despair. Sometimes that despair is expressed in an\nunhealthy anger which feels like resentment towards God. At other\ntimes we can develop a silent desperation. Our confidence in God has\ngone and we stop praying, resigning ourself to the belief that\nnothing will change. The writer of Hebrews tells us that we can come\nwith confidence to God, (Hebrews 4:13). Having confidence in God is\nhaving a settled belief that God\u2019s response to our prayers is\nalways appropriate.  </strong></p><p><strong>What\nJesus is saying in this parable is very profound. The only way we can\ndevelop into people whose lives are defined by prayer is to know Gods\ncharacter. The glorious goodness of God\u2019s unchanging character will\nalways stimulate prayer. Maybe one of the reasons why we struggle so\nmuch with prayer is because our distorted views of Him prevent us\nfrom really knowing him. As we gaze upon his beauty and are\ndistracted by his glory we will find ourselves wanting to pray. God\nis nothing like this unjust judge, he is kind and compassionate, he\ncares and understands, and his heart is for us. That is why we can\npray at all times.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\ngives us a better understanding of the life of faith.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nLuke 17, Jesus had been teaching on his second coming, and the\nparable of the widow and the unjust judge was given to help us to\nlive faithful lives until Jesus returns. So in verse 8 Jesus says\n\u2019When the Son of man returns, how many will he find on earth who\nhave faith.\u2019 The scary thing about this verse is its context. Is\nJesus using this parable as a means of gauging faithfulness? Is the\nfaith he longs to see expressed through those who always pray and\nnever give up? When Jesus returns, we all want to hear the words\n\u2018Well done my good and faithful servant. In some ways this parable\ngives us all an opportunity to hear these words. Jesus could have\ndefined faithfulness in lots of different ways, but He chose to use\nsomething that everyone of us can do no matter who we are, that to\npray always without giving up.</strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme close with this question. \u2018Would you like to become a man/woman\nof prayer, or do you need to become a man/woman of prayer?\u2019   Let\nus not give up. Let us make prayer part of every area of our lives.</strong></p><p><strong>Prayer:</strong> . Father,</p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Exodus 2:1-5:9</p>",

The interesting thing about these\nverses is that Jesus does not talk about the \u2018activities\u2019 of the\nbad shepherds or their theology, but their characters.  </strong></p><p><strong>A\nbad shepherd is someone who refuses to be honest with themselves.\nLook at the question they asked Jesus. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018What?\nAre we blind too?\u2019 </strong></span><strong>\nJohn 9:40.  This is a very interesting question that reveals a lot\nabout the Pharisees. They were unable to evaluate their own lives;\nthey lived in denial, and could not cope with reality. They were\nblind to their blindness. They were unable to correctly evaluate\ntheir own spiritual condition. They found comfort in lying to\nthemselves about themselves  Often people find it easier to deal with\nother peoples problems than deal with their own, this is a common\nform of denial and self-deception.</strong></p><p><strong>A\nbad shepherd is some one who has a confused morality. Jesus said in\nresponse to the Pharisees question, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cIf\nyou were blind you would not be guilty of sin.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nIn other words your claim not to be blind makes you more calculable\nfor your sin. Because you think you have spiritual insight and\nunderstanding, you are more more guilty of sin. Any refusal on our\npart to make honest and spiritual evaluations about ourselves will\nresult in us having wrong perceptions and making wrong judgements\nabout others.</strong></p><p><strong>A\nbad shepherd is one that lives under guilt. Jesus concludes in verse\n41 with saying </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018but\nnow that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n Jesus is not speaking here about being motivated by guilt; rather he\nis speaking about living under the condemnation of God.

Without\nfreedom we will not be able to serve others.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nbad shepherd is someone who lacks honesty, morality and freedom.\nThese people may not have set out with the intention of being bad in\nthe sense that they are unable to implement good pastoral care for\nothers, rather their bad shepherding is the symptomatic and\nspontaneous result of their character.

It is more about the people we are\nthan the spiritual gifts we may have.</strong></p><p><strong>[a]\nThe Good shepherd lays down his life because he is good.</strong></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\">\u2018<strong>I\nam the good shepherd, and the good shepherd lays down his life for\nthe sheep.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nThe word good (Greek: kalos) shepherd. Barclay notes that there are\ntwo Greek words for good. The first is agathos, which \"simply\ndescribes the moral quality of a thing.\" The second is kalos,\n\"which means that a thing or a person is not only good; but in\nthe goodness there is a quality of winsomeness, loveliness,\nattractiveness which makes it a lovely thing.\" It refers to\nsomeone who was more than just a good person.\nhttps://www.trinitycoatesville.org/sermons/whats-good-about-a-shepherd-2/</strong></p><p><strong>They\nwould also be someone that we could count on to be there for us in a\ntime of crisis. Someone who would offer us support, prays for us, or\nbrings meals by for us. They would be the person that we could call\nin the middle of the night without reservation if we needed them.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nClassical literature the word kalos was a picture word that was used\nto describe</strong></p><p><strong>A\nSuitable Harbour.</strong></p><p><strong>A\nHealthy Body.</strong></p><p><strong>Pure\ngenuine gold.</strong></p><p><strong>An\nunblemished sacrifice.</strong></p><p><strong>[b]\nThe good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep because of the\nrelationship he has with them.</strong></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\">\u2018<strong>I\nam the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me- Just as\nthe Father knows me and I know the Father- and I lay down my life for\nthe sheep.\u2019   </strong></span></p><p><strong>I\nthink this is one of the most profound verses in the New Testament.,,</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nmodels his relationships with people on his relationship with his\nfather,</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u2018I know my sheep and my sheep know me- Just as the Father knows me\nand I know the father.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n The implications of these words are very scary. If we were to have\nthe same kind of relationships with people that we have with God,\nwhat kind of community would we be? The heart attitudes that a person\nneeds to know and love God, are the same heart attitudes we need to\nknow and love people.</strong></p><p><strong>We\ncannot say that we love God and hate our brother. The only way we can\nlay down our lives for God is to lay it down for people</strong></p><p><strong>Because\nJesus knew his sheep he laid down his life. It is easier to live a\nsacrificial life in order to help a friend than it is to help a\nstranger.</strong></p><p><strong>Many\npeople in positions of leadership struggle with fulfilling their God\ngiven responsibilities because they are emotionally disengaged from\nthose they are trying to serve and lead.  Knowing the sheep will help\nthe shepherd to lay down his life. If you understand and care for the\npeople God has made you responsible for, you are going to want to lay\ndown your life in order to show your love for them.</strong></p><p><strong>Father,\nhelp me to be mature enough to lay down my life.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Exodus 12:1-14:20</p>",

Jesus said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018I\nknow my sheep and my sheep know me.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nPart of the process of laying down your life is to become known. It\nis to open yourself up, becoming vulnerable, sharing your pain,\nweaknesses, and sin. The laid down life is one were there are no\nmasks, pretences or performances, but honest openness. Knowing and\nbeing known are essential if we are going to find God\u2019s appointed\nplace for our lives.</strong></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\">\u2018<strong>The\nreason why my Father loves me is that I lay down my life.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nIt would be very easy to conclude from this verse that Jesus was\nsaying that he needed to earn his father\u2019s love by laying down his\nlife. We know from the scriptures  that God\u2019s love cannot be bought\nor earned, so how are we to understand these words?</strong></p><p><strong>Could\nit be that Jesus\u2019 willing sacrifice elicited the Father\u2019s eternal\nlove in a fresh way? For example, I have loved Caroline  for over 25\nyears. Now if  she does something that reflects her love for me,\nwhich would cause my love for her  to well up in a fresh way so that\nI say, \u201cI love you for doing that for me.\u201d The love was there\nbefore her deed, but her deed called forth my love once more</strong></p><p><strong>I\nthink Jesus is saying that when he laid down his life it did not\ncause God to love his Son. But it caused the love God  had for his\nSon to to well up inside him. Maybe this is Jesus\u2019 way of saying\nthat the lad down life brings great joy and pleasure to  God. The\nlaying down of Jesus' life for the sheep is an act that expresses to\nthe world that Jesus felt secure in his father\u2019s love.  Because\nJesus felt secure in his father\u2019s love he was prepared to lay down\nhis life and eventually die on the cross.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nkind of \u2018laid down life\u2019 that God is looking for is only possible\nwhen we are feeling secure in the love of God. Feelings of insecurity\nwill prevent a person from living a sacrificial and laid down life,\nbecause insecurity encourages and develops selfishness within a\nperson.  The more we receive and enjoy God\u2019s love the more secure\nwe will be, and the more secure we are the more equipped we will be\nto lay down our lives.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsecurity Jesus felt meant that he had the authority to lay down his\nlife. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018No\none takes it from me but I lay it down of my own accord. I have\nauthority to lay it down and authority to take it up again.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n This is alluding to Jesus\u2019 death, but in this context it is\nprimarily referring to how Jesus lived. The word that John uses for\nauthority literally means \u2018unrestricted possibility or freedom of\naction.\u2019  In other words Jesus was free enough to lay down his\nlife.  </strong></p><p><strong>When\na person is free because they feel secure in the love of God, then\nthey will be prepared to meet the demands and sacrifices that the\nChristian life demands. We cannot live the life of a Christian\nwithout a conscious knowledge of God\u2019s love. Knowledge of God\u2019s\nlove is the most effective sanctifying and freeing influence a person\ncan experience.   </strong></p><p><strong>In\nlaying down his life for others Jesus was outworking the natural\nconsequences of obeying his Father\u2019s commandments. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u2018I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again.\nThis commandment I have received from my father.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nIn our western culture we have over individualised obedience, but\nevery time we obey the word of God, it is not solely for our own\nindividual and personal benefit, but it is also for the enrichment\nand encouragement of others. Obedience to the commandments will equip\na person for his ordination, it will make a laid down life a reality.</strong></p><p><strong>With\nthat in mind, let me mention our understanding of abundant that Jesus\nrefers to in verse 10. . Abundant life is not an individualistic\nexperience; rather it is the result of feeling secure within the\nflock. . Abundant life is a relational quality that is discovered in\nthe midst of community. Abundant life is an impossible individual\nexperience.</strong></p><p><strong>Father,\nmay my love for you be seen in me laying down my life for others</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Exodus 14:21-17:16</p>",

The word John uses\nis </strong><em><strong>misthotos</strong></em><strong>\nwas used to refer to day labourers working for a wage of normally one\ndrachma per day. It is unlikely a shepherd would hire a hand for the\nday, if he knew that the hired hand was intending to harm his flock\nand destroy his livelihood.</strong></p><p><strong>Although\nthis hired hand did not set out with the intended purpose of harming\nthe sheep, the pressures and demands of the job exposed flaws in his\ncharacter, which made him a threat to the sheep. So what kind of\nperson was this?</strong></p><p><strong>He\nhad more fear than courage.  Because of his lack of courage he was\ncontrolled by fear, making him unable to fulfil his responsibilities\nand deal with the realities of the job, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018when\nhe sees a wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n Our level of commitment to people is reflected in the amount of\ncourage we show.</strong></p><p><strong>Often\npeople can begin a ministry with every intention of being faithful\nand committed to the work God has called them to, often they start\nwith every intention of showing care, however, when problems arise\nthey can often abandon their responsibilities because of a lack of\ncare and courage.. </strong></p><p><strong>He\nis more concerned with the protection of self than the protection of\nthe sheep. Jesus said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018when\nhe sees a wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n Notice that this hired hand had no contact with the wolf; he didn\u2019t\nabandon the sheep after he had some physical contact with the wolf,\nbut when he saw the wolf he ran away.   </strong></p><p><strong>The\nword thaat John uses for \u2018see\u2019 in this passage is the Greek word\ntheoreo. Theoreo denotes \u2018deliberate contemplation.\u2019 The\nperceptions we hold are never accidental or enforced upon us, rather\nthey are the result of deliberate and considered thinking, be that\nright or wrong. So when this hireling saw the wolf his understanding\nand considered conclusion was, \u2018I\u2019m scared I need to get out of\nhere.\u2019   His running and abandoning the sheep may have the\nappearance of being spontaneous and not thought through, but it\nwasn\u2019t. It was the result of deliberately formed perceptions that\ngoverned his life.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nhired hand in Jesus\u2019 story was more concerned about himself than he\nwas about the sheep; it was natural for him to avoid difficulties and\nconfrontation in order to save his own skin. A bad shepherd will\navoid confrontation, and refuse to deal with problems that may arise\nin case he damages his reputation, for him pleasing people is more\nimportant than facing and tackling difficult issues.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nhired hand had unrealistic expectations. Was he surprised that a wolf\nwould attack the flock? Was he not hired with the expressed purpose\nof protecting the sheep from possible predators like wolves? This\nhired hand was not prepared for something that was likely to happen\n</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018The\nhired hand will run away.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nTwice Jesus tells us that the hired hand will run.   </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018He\nabandons the sheep and runs away.\u2019  </strong></span><strong>\nThe word for run is the Greek word </strong><em><strong>pheugo</strong></em><strong>\nwhere we get our English word fugitive from; it literally means \u2018to\nseek safety in flight\u2019 or \u2018to escape from danger.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>In\nChristian ministry people often run away, sometimes this literally\nmeans running away, leaving work or moving geographically. But more\noften the running away can be a more subtle and less obvious. People\nbecome emotionally detached, they build walls, they loose their\npassion, doing the very least they can get away with doing, for in\ntheir hearts they have run away.</strong></p><p><strong>Running\naway is never a benign or an exclusively individual experience, Jesus\ntells us. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Then\nthe wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nIn other words, when we run others suffer. Running away may feel\ntotally personal, but it never is and never can be. When we are\ntrying to avoid truth, responsibilities or circumstances, others will\nsuffer because of our avoidance of reality.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword used for scatter is the Greek word \"skorpizo.\" The\nroot of the verb means, \u2018to pierce!\u2019  It gives us the English\nword \"scorpion.\"  Having a lack of courage, pursuing\nself-protection and running away from responsibilities, circumstances\nand truth will be a sting in the tail to others.  </strong></p><p><strong>How\nshould we handle the wolves when they come?</strong></p><p><strong>The\nonly way we will have the courage and the spiritual resources to face\nthe wolves, i.e. the demanding challenges that will confronts us, is\nto live a \u2018laid down\u2019 life. If we have already laid down our\nlives, then we will not fear what any predator may do to us.</strong></p><p><strong>Being\na good shepherd is very difficult, demanding and challenging.\nHowever, to be like this hired hand and run because of a lack of\ncourage, (although may appear the easier option), will cause us to do\nuntold harm to God\u2019s flock.  So if we want to live the life that\nJesus did, we need to be willing to \u2018lay down\u2019 our lives.</strong></p><p><strong>Father.\nI recognise  that my insecurities have the ability to turn me into a\nhired hand.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Exodus 18:1-21:21</p>",

His\npower and love to do miracles was rooted in the courage of a\ncruciform life. Jesus understood that the subversive nature of his\nministry would cause a kick back, it would lead to a negative and\nsometimes death threatening reaction.

    "html": "<p><strong>This\nstory is about Jesus helping to understand forgiveness.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to think as these Jews would have thought.  The physical healing\nsignified the spiritual healing.  In general, Jewish thinking was\nthat sickness and misfortune were the result of sin.  Perhaps Jewish\nteachers did not link all ailments to specific sins, but they did\nunderstand that in some way such misfortunes were related to God\u2019s\nfavour being removed.  The Healing's that took place, even the\nmiraculous Healing\u2019s of Jesus, indicated that the offences of the\npersons had been removed and God\u2019s favour restored.</strong></p><p><strong>So,\nit would not have been shocking if after Jesus had healed the\nparalytic, he then said,</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\n Everyone would have understood that he was simply making an\nobservation or giving assurance of what God had evidently done.  What\nthrew everyone off was pronouncing forgiveness before the healing. \nWhy did he do that?  To make the point that he wasn\u2019t simply\npronouncing what he believed God had done for the man or was about to\ndo.  He himself was forgiving the man\u2019s sins.</strong></p><p><strong>By\nreversing the order of healing and forgiving, he demonstrated that he\nwas more than a prophet given a word of insight by God, but that he\npossessed the very divine prerogative to forgive.  The authority to\nheal signified the authority to forgive.  As Jesus said in verse 10:</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><sup><em><strong>\n</strong></em></sup></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><em><strong>But\nthat you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to\nforgive sins....\u201d</strong></em></span><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>The\nwords, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018</strong></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><em><strong>your\nsins are forgiven</strong></em></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>,\u2019\n</strong></span><strong>were\nmore than a pronouncement; they were an act performed by one with\ndivine authority to do so.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus sees the paralytic man he says </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Son\nyou sins are forgiven.\u2019 </strong></span><strong>At\nthis time their was a strong belief that sickness and disability was\neither the result of the persons sin or their parents sin. The\nRabbi's taught a person could sin in the womb before birth, see John\n9:1-2. The Scribes had created categories of people for whom they\nknow God doesn\u2019t like \u2013 Gentiles, prostitutes, tax collectors,\ntanners, lepers, shepherds, women who are barren, and people with\ndisabilities and deformities. So when the people saw this Paralytic\nman, they had him categorised, they saw him as someone who was\ncondemned, someone who deserved to be disabled, someone who was being\npunished for his sin and that may be one of the reasons why the crowd\nwould not let him in. So Jesus says in front of all the religious\nleaders, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Son\nyour sins are forgiven.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nIn saying this Jesus was confronting the stereotypical perceptions of\nillness and disability </strong></p><p><strong>These\nprofessional theologians knew the hidden implication to which the\nrest of the crowd were oblivious to. By claiming the ability to\nforgive sins Jesus was claiming to be equal to God himself. </strong><strong>According\nto Jewish belief, no man not even a messiah\u2014would have the\nauthority to forgive sins. </strong><strong>In\nthe teaching of the Pharisees, blasphemy was the most evil sin to\nwhich any human being could stoop to. No wonder they were both\noutraged and secretly delighted at the same time. This dangerous new\nrabbi was trapped by his own words, public words that had been\nuttered in front of many witnesses.</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>Judaism\nhad determined that even the promised, Messiah could not forgive\nsins. So, these scribes took Jesus\u2019 assertion as an affront to\nGod\u2019s majesty, if not an implied claim to be God. In the Torah,\ninsulting God\u2019s dignity was the primary basis of blasphemy.</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword forgiveness is one of those words that is used a lot in\nChristian circles. But I don\u2019t think we fully grasp it meaning or\nimplications. </strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>The\nword \"</strong><strong><strong>forgive</strong></strong><strong>\"\nis the Greek word </strong><strong><strong>aphiemi</strong></strong><strong>.\nIt means to set free; to let go; to release; to discharge; or to\nliberate completely. It was used in a secular sense in New Testament\ntimes in reference to cancelling a debt or releasing someone from the\nobligation of a contract, a commitment, or promise. Thus, it means to\nforfeit any right to hold a person captive to a previous commitment\nor wrong he has committed. In essence, it is the picture of totally\nfreeing and releasing someone. A modern paraphrase of this Greek word\nwould simply be to </strong><strong><strong>let\nit go</strong></strong><strong>!\nThis means you and I don't have the privilege of\u00a0</strong><strong><strong>holding\npeople hostage to their past actions if they repent and ask us to\nforgive them.\u2019 Rick Rener.\n</strong></strong><u><a href=\"https://renner.org/article/confront-forgive-and-forget/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>https://renner.org/article/confront-forgive-and-forget/</strong></a></u><strong><strong>\n access 21/03/2025</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>In\nthe ancient world when a slave was set free after the death of his\nmaster sometimes the word aphiemi was used.

There was a\nlegend in the early church that he was a stonemason. We will come\nback to this</strong></p><p><strong>We\nknow from Luke\u2019s account that it was the man\u2019s right hand Luke\n6:6. This is important because, the right hand in scripture is often\na symbol of ability, power or strength. So because of this man\ndisability he was probably denied employment, and therefore financial\nsecurity; he would have been denied access to the temple in Jerusalem\nbecause it would have been believed that his physical condition was a\nconsequence of his sin. The right hand was also considered the clean\nhand. The left hand was always used to keep the body clean, and to\nshake hands with your left hand was considered offensive.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nis a very unusual miracle for Jesus. In that, usually when Jesus did\nsome miraculous work he did it away from public gaze, but on this\noccasion he asked the man to stand up in front of every one, he\nwanted everyone to see what he was about to do.</strong></p><p><strong>Writing\nabout this incident Dr Ron Charles says </strong></p><p><strong>According\nto historical records, Herod the great, initiated many building\nprojects during his time, including one to enhance the Jewish temple.\nThe temple was a magnificent piece of work. In order to build the\ntemple, Herod hired a project manager called Jeshu Bensee and also\n217 of the finest stonemasons that the region had to offer. While the\nsubstructure work was still underway, Herod feared that he would die\nand hence he decided to speed up the building work. The stonemasons\nwere ordered to work round the clock, seven days a week, including\nthe Sabbath. Jeshu Bensee convinced the high priest and religious\nleaders that this was necessary and would benefit the temple. They\ngave their approval and all 217 stonemasons worked round the clock to\nfinish their work on the temple. Once that was completed, the Romans\nwanted to build the Tower of Antonio, the administrative headquarters\nof the Roman governor in Jerusalem. The Romans also demanded that the\nstonemasons work around the clock to complete this work in record\ntime. Once again, Jeshu Bensee convinced the high priest to issue a\nproclamation called the Sabbath of Weeks, which allowed the\nstonemasons to work on Sabbaths until the work was completed. At long\nlast, the work was done. Jeshu Bensee organized a celebration in\nhonour of the stonemasons who had worked so hard, along with their\nfamilies. It was a gala time, but at some point in the celebration\nJeshu Bensee stood up and spoke to the stonemasons. He told them that\nthey had broken Jewish law by agreeing to work on the Sabbath. They\nwould be forgiven for working on the Sabbath on account of the temple\nbut not for the extra work they did on the Tower. He said that it\nwould have been better for them to refuse and face death, then to\nbreak the law. The punishment meted out to the stonemasons and their\nfamilies was barbaric in order to make an example of them. Their\npunishment included the crushing of the right hand of all the 217\nstonemasons, thereby taking away their livelihood. The eyes of the\nchildren and their wives were gorged out. The stonemasons were\nseparated from their families for ever, and they were forced to wear\nsackcloth and beg at the synagogue. No one spoke to them and they\nwere not allowed to speak to anyone. The high priest told them that\nGod hated them and had rejected and abandoned them forever.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>If\nthese facts are true, then Jesus was making a huge statement. He was\nbringing people like this stonemason out from the edges of society,\nback into the centre .      </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you for Jesus\u2019 power to expose people\u2019s hearts. </strong></p><p><strong>Bible\non a year </strong><strong>Exodus\n38:1-31</strong></p>",

    "html": "<p><strong>What\ncan this story teach us?</strong></p><p><strong>It\nteaches us that some things make Jesus angry. There are a number of\ntimes in the gospels where we see Jesus expressing anger, for example\nwhen he turned the tables over in the temple, or when he was at the\ngrave side of Lazarus. But this is the only time that we are\nexplicitly told that Jesus was angry.</strong></p><p><strong>An\n\u2018angry Jesus,\u2019 is a Jesus we are not too happy with.  I read\nrecently about a toy manufacturer who made a \u2018Jesus doll\u2019 It was\na \u2018hug able, washable, talking,\u2019 doll sporting fuzzy dread locks\nand satiny beard. When you pulled out the string it said things like.\n\u2018I love you.\u2019 \u2018I have great plans for you life.\u2019 \u2018Be good\nto your mother and father.\u2019 That is the kind of Jesus we want. We\ndon\u2019t want a \u2018Jesus,\u2019 who gets angry, and we certainly don\u2019t\nwant a Jesus who confronts us and shatters how we see and do life.\nThe incident of the healing of the man with the withered hand was a\n\u2018divine wrecking ball,\u2019 that was going to shatter how these\nreligious people understood life.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nlife of Jesus will cause us to rethink our understanding of anger.\nFor Jesus anger was an expression of perfect humanity, it was a\nnecessary virtue that was required to ensure the fulfilment of the\nloving purposes of God. It was an expression of holy living, an\nexcellent manifestation of morality. For Jesus, expressed anger was\nconsistent with his love and grace. It was a refusal to accept the\nreign of evil, It was a choice to make a difference in situations\nwhere cruelty and injustice appeared to have control. </strong></p><p><strong>Did\nJesus not clearly condemn anger? </strong></p><p><em><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\">\u201c<strong>You\nhave heard that it was said to the people long ago, \u2018Do not murder,\nand anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.\u2019\u00a0 But I\ntell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to\njudgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, \u2018Raca,\u2019 is\nanswerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, \u2018You fool!\u2019\nwill be in danger of the fire of hell.</strong></span></em><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u00a0(Matt\n5:21-22) .</strong></span></p><p><strong>Notice\nthat Jesus gives two examples of the kind of anger he means. The\nfirst example is to use the term of contempt:\u00a0</strong><em><strong>Raca.</strong></em><strong>\u00a0This\nterm is hard to translate so it is simply rendered in the Aramaic.\nEssentially what it means  is to strip a person of any dignity and to\nregard them with utter contempt. The term\u00a0</strong><em><strong>fool</strong></em><strong>;\nhas a similar, though less egregious, purpose. Hence, it would seem\nthat the Lord is not condemning all anger her but rather the anger of\ncontempt and depersonalization..</strong></p><p><strong>The\nproblem is we have taken the virtue of anger and turned it into a\nvice. Our sin has deformed and distorted the virtue of anger so much,\nthat it has become the means by which we express resentment, revenge\nand control. We have made it into  </strong><strong>manifestation</strong><strong>\nof acute selfishness, instead of it being a motivating influence\nagainst injustice and the suffering of others.</strong></p><p><strong>Selfishness\nhas the ability to intoxicate and weaponise anger. When anger ceases\nto a virtue that causes us to react to the abuse of others.. then it\nwill become toxic selfishness that will poison us, and a weapon that\nwe will use to destroy others for our own benefit.</strong></p><p><strong>Sadly\nthe selfless anger that Jesus displayed is rarely seen in the church.\nI think there are  two reasons for this. Firstly their seems to be a\ntsunami of apathy, the church does not care enough to </strong><strong>demonstrate\nthe virtue of selfless anger. It is interesting that the words for\ndisobedience and unbelief in the New Testament come from the Greek\nword from which we get our English word apathy. </strong></p><p><strong>Secondly,\nbecause we are so accustomed to selfish, toxic anger, we can assume\nthat all anger is wrong.  </strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Holy\nanger is not driven by a desire to judge or get even but by a desire\nto love people and set them free. Holy anger does not involve\nscreaming for your rights but advocating for the rights of others.\nHoly anger is not about proving a point but about proving that\neveryone has value. Holy anger is not about personal gain but about\nrestoring personal dignity to others. Holy anger comes in many forms\nand is expressed in multiple ways, but the result is always the same:\naction is taken in the name of Jesus to loosen chains of injustice,\nrestore dignity and rescue people.\u2019 Jamie Snyder     </strong></p><p><strong>I\nwonder what causes us to be angry?</strong></p><p><strong>Tim\nKeller wrote \u2018There\u2019s nothing wrong with being ticked \u2014 getting\nangry to a degree \u2014 if somebody slights your reputation, but why\nare you ten times \u2014\u00a0</strong><em><strong>a\nhundred times</strong></em><strong>\u00a0\u2014\nmore angry about it than some horrible violent injustice being done\nto people in another part of the world? Do you know why?  Because if\nwhat you\u2019re really looking to for your significance and security is\npeople\u2019s approval or a good reputation or status or something like\nthat, then when anything gets between you and the thing you have to\nhave, you become implacably angry.

As does Luke. Luke 6:8 tells us that \u2018Jesus\nknew what they were thinking\u2019 What was upsetting Jesus at this time\nis that they were looking great, they were ticking all the boxes,\nthey were sitting on their usual seats in the Synagogue, but their\nattitudes was a cause of offence and anger to Jesus. The religious\npeople were highly respected members of society. They had a deep love\nfor the word of God, they could quote whole books of the Old\nTestament, they were trying to live \u2018holy lives,\u2019 but they made\nJesus angry. </strong></p><p><strong>Mark\ntells us \u2018they wanted some reason to accuse Jesus.\u2019 The word\naccuse is a technical legal term which means to mount a legal case\nagainst someone in order to collect evidence against them. It comes\nfrom two Greek words  \u2018Agora,\u2019 a place of public speaking,\nprefixed by \u2018kata\u2019 meaning against. Hence it means speaking\nagainst a person before a public tribunal. It wasn\u2019t that they\nstumbled on an issue that proved problematical to their\nunderstanding, but they were determined to find a reason to publicly\naccuse, humiliate and embarrass Jesus, so they could control him.\nThey were sitting in judgement, they were hoping that Jesus would\nincriminate himself.  This same word kategoreo is the same word that\nour English word category from. They wanted to accuse Jesus so they\ncould put him into a category that suited them. When Jesus did not\nact in ways they thought he should act, they attempt to put Jesus in\na box that suited their theology and belief system.  We would never\ndo that!</strong></p><p><strong>They\nwatched Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe are told that they \u2018watched\u2019 Jesus a very rare word is used\nwhich is found only six times in the New Testament. The word carries\nthe idea of watching with evil intent, with hostility, and suspicion.\n Outside the bible this same word was used to describe the process of\nof observing that the legal demands of the law be fulfilled.   </strong></p><p><strong>How\nthey watched Jesus was an amazing revelation of their hearts, they\nwere critical and judgemental, hoping that they would have an\nopportunity to humiliate and correct Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>They\nhad hard/stubborn hearts</strong></p><p><strong>In\nresponse to the question \u00a0</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cWhich\nis lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or\nto kill?\u201d</strong></span><strong>\n the religious leaders remained silent. Their silence was really a\nrevelation of their hearts. This was not a difficult question. Who\nwould want to do evil or kill, especially on the Sabbath. God\nintended the Sabbath to be a day of rest, a day for blessing a day of\ndoing good. But the malicious silence of these religious people was\nreally a loud declaration about the evil of their hearts.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nreading this story, it would be very easy to read the phrase\nstubborn/hard heart as a throw away statement.  But it needs to be\nunderstood as a defining or an identifying status of these religious\npeople. The word for Stubborn/hard is porosis.  </strong></p><p><strong>William\nBarclay\u00a0writes that. </strong><strong>Porosis\ncomes from poros, which originally meant a stone that was harder than\nmarble. It came to have certain medical uses. It was used for the\nchalk stone which can form in the joints and completely paralyse\naction. It was used of the callus that forms where a bone has been\nbroken and re-set, a callus which is harder than the bone itself.\nFinally the word came to mean the loss of all power of sensation; it\ndescribed something which had become so hardened, so petrified that\nit had no power to feel at all.\u2019 \n</strong><a href=\"https://www.sermonindex.net/modules/articles/index.php?view=article&aid=34196\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>https://www.sermonindex.net/modules/articles/index.php?view=article&amp;aid=34196</strong></a><strong>.\nAccessed 17/06/25</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword also suggests a dull mind someone who had chosen to close their\nmind and refuse to think differently or see things from a different\nperspective </strong></p><p><strong>I\nthink this is probably one of the greatest tragedy's of the human\nheart, to be incapable of feeling sympathy or compassion. Being hard\nin the inside, unmoved by the pain of others. Hardened by bitterness\nand sin and loosing what it means to be truly human. </strong></p><p><strong>These\nreligious leaders were so hard and indifferent to the needs of\nothers. They had developed dispassionate hearts that were unable to\nengage compassionately or sympathetically with others.   </strong></p><p><strong>You\ncould sum up these Scribes and Pharisees as</strong></p><p><strong>a.\nThey like rules.</strong></p><p><strong>b.\nThey see themselves as the guardians of right and wrong.</strong></p><p><strong>c.\nThey are quick to criticise and slow to compliment.</strong></p><p><strong>d.\nThey see the bad in people, not the good enough, never reconsigning\nthe beauty and good in others.</strong></p><p><strong>e.\nThey wish every one else was more like them.</strong></p><p><strong>f.\nThey don\u2019t like it when others don\u2019t see the bible as they do.</strong></p><p><strong>g.\nKeeping the rule is more important than meeting needs of others</strong></p><p><strong>h.\nThey are issue driven not compassionate.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\u2019\nanger was mixed with deep sorrow. This is the only time the word\n\u2019syllypeo\u2019 deep sorrow is used in the bible. It carries the idea\n</strong><em><strong>\u00a0\u201cto\nfeel sympathy, be deeply distressed for someone, to feel sorry for\nsomeone, to be moved with grief\u201d.</strong></em><strong>\n The attitude of the Scribes and Pharisees caused Jesus not only\nanger but pain.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nI had been in Jesus\u2019 position, and was able to silence my critics I\nwould have felt satisfied. Not Grieved. But Jesus was grieved by the\nconsequences caused by these peoples hard hearts. His heart was full\nof sorrow because they did not care for the needy. This distress that\nJesus was feeling is the key to understanding this passage. The\nSabbath was given as an expression of God\u2019s mercy. God wanted the\nSabbath to be all about doing good not evil, about saving life not\nkilling it. These people had moved so far from authentic humanity,\nand God\u2019s purposes that they caused Jesus great distress.</strong></p><p><strong>For\nthese religious leaders, programmes were more important than people.\nsustaining the status-quo was more important than mercy, and this\ncaused great pain to Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>What\nMark is doing here is showing us the contrast between the hard\nhearted attitude of the Pharisees, and the grieving heart of Jesus.  </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me to rightly access and evaluate the circumstances I  find\nmyself.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Exodus 40:17-38; Leviticus 1-4</p>",

By NT times, however, the concept\nincorporated compassionate response. A person who felt for and with a\nsufferer would be moved to help.

I considered myself a\nChristian. I attended church since I was a small boy. We had heard\nthe stories of what was happening to the Jews, but like most people\ntoday in this country, we tried to distance ourselves from the\nreality of what was really taking place. What could anyone do to stop\nit?</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>A\nrailroad track ran behind our small church, and each Sunday morning\nwe would hear the whistle from a distance and then the clacking of\nthe wheels moving over the track. We became disturbed when one Sunday\nwe noticed cries coming from the train as it passed by. We grimly\nrealized that the train was carrying Jews. They were like cattle in\nthose cars!</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>Week\nafter week, that train whistle would blow. We would dread to hear the\nsound of those old wheels because we knew that the Jews would begin\nto cry out to us as they passed our church. It was so terribly\ndisturbing! We could do nothing to help these poor miserable people,\nyet their screams tormented us. We knew exactly at what time that\nwhistle would blow, and we decided the only way to keep from being so\ndisturbed by the cries was to start singing our hymns. By the time\nthat train came rumbling past the churchyard, we were singing at the\ntop of our voices. If some of the screams reached our ears, we\u2019d\njust sing a little louder until we could hear them no more. Years\nhave passed, and no one talks about it much any more, but I still\nhear that train whistle in my sleep. I can still hear them crying out\nfor help. God forgive all of us who called ourselves Christians, yet\ndid nothing to intervene.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes\nwe choose to be oblivious to the backing tract to our lives, we can\nsing at the top of our voices to drown out the desperate cries of the\nneedy </strong></p><p><strong>There\nis just one more thing I want you to notice. Did the man seek Jesus\nout? Did he cry out for relief \u2013 fall at Jesus\u2019 feet and beg for\nmercy? Did he even ask to be healed? No. This is the only miracle in\nMatthew, Mark and Luke that Jesus initiates, without being approached\nor asked. That is what mercy does, it initiates relevant acts of\nmercy. Mercy will sacrifice religious traditions for the sake of\nothers. Any life or ministry that is not continually expressing acts\nof mercy is not really of God, and it breaks the heart of Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay the back ground noise in my life produce a response of mercy </strong></p><p><strong>The\nseventy-two returned with joy and said, \u201cLord, even the demons\nsubmit to us in your name.\u201d He replied, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>I\nsaw Satan fall like lightning from heaven I have given you authority\nto trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of\nthe enemy; nothing will harm you.

When I speak of a philosophy of ministry I am referring to\nhow we think about ministry and how we understand ourselves in the\ncontext of that ministry. Or put it an other way.  If my\nunderstanding of the ministry is not rooted in how Jesus understood\nministry, then I will find myself struggling wit</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>\na host of spiritual, emotional and psychological problems.</strong></p><p><strong>This\npassage contains one of the most challenging and penetrating\nincidents recorded in all the gospels. This is a passage that goes\nway beyond the surface and deals with dominate issues of the heart.\nThis is a passage that pulls off the covers we hide under, and\nexposes our real priorities and insecurities As the seventy two\nreturn to Jesus and begin to tell Jesus about their successful\nmission, Jesus uses this as an opportunity to deal with a crucial\nissue that will prepare them for life and ministry in the future</strong></p><p><strong>The\nseventy two have just returned from the mission Jesus had sent them\non, and to their surprise they were able to exercise power over\ndemons. This was surprising for two reasons</strong></p><p><strong>The\ncontext.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nthe previous chapter (9:40), a number of the 12 disciples have failed\nto exorcise a demon. They were unable to do something that the\nseventy/seventy two were able to do. These seventy/seventy two were\npowerful and effective. Jesus had not mentioned casting out demons in\nhis commissioning (10:5-11), of the seventy two but they gained power\nover demons. Exorcism was not something Jesus told them to do in this\ncommission, but \"eat,\"  \"heal,\" and \"tell\"\n(v. 8b-9). The Twelve were given \"power and authority over all\ndemons\" in 9:1 not the seventy two. So think of the surprise and\njoy they must have felt when they returned to Jesus and began to\ncritique their experience in ministry. Before we look at the passage\nlet me say a word about the importance of critiquing our ministry. \nAs we have said, this passage as a lot to say about having a right\nperspective on ministry and the importance of critiquing it.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\ngive me the wisdom to wisely critique the ministry you have given me.\n</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Leviticus 8:1-11:8</p>",

Being accountable does not mean that others\nhave the right to control or manipulate you</strong></p><p><strong>Often\nwe think that a ministry should be critiqued if it has failed or is\nin the process of failing. But no matter where a ministry is at,\nperiodically it requires an in depth scrutiny and examination.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nprocess of critiquing a ministry must take place in the presence of\nJesus. It is interesting that we often say more to Jesus before we do\nministry while the diciples said more to Jesus after they had\nfinished their ministry. We need to develop the habit of bringing our\nministry to Jesus when they appear to be concluded, in order to get\nhis perspective.</strong></p><p><strong>To\ncritique is not a licence to criticise or condemn,  </strong><strong>Christian\ncounsellor Henry Cloud says that in healthy relationships a minimum\nof five meaningful encouragements should be shared for every one\ncriticism.</strong><strong>\n Nor is the critiquing an opportunity for someone to manipulate their\nagenda into a specific situation.

Jesus came\nto earth as the second Adam to shows us what it \u2018really\u2019 means to\nbe human. You could say that to become like Jesus is to become \u2018more\u2019\nor a \u2018better\u2019 human, it is to discover God\u2019s original intention\nfor us.

As\na human being Jesus had the same needs as you and me. Yes he was\nabsolutely sinless, but that does not mean that he never made\nmistakes, or had accidents. All sins are mistakes but all mistakes\nare not sin</strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme quote you something from a book called The Shack:-  </strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Mack\nstood in the bathroom, looking into the mirror while wiping his face\ndry with a towel. He was searching for some sign of insanity in those\neyes staring back at him. Was this real? Of course not, it was\nimpossible. But then . . . He reached out his hand and slowly touched\nthe mirror. Maybe this was a hallucination being brought on by all\nhis grief and despair. Maybe it was a dream, and he was asleep\nsomewhere, maybe in the shack freezing to death? Maybe . . .\nSuddenly, a terrible crash broke into his reverie. It came from the\ndirection of the kitchen, and Mack froze. For a moment there was dead\nsilence, and then unexpectedly, he heard uproarious laughter.\nCurious, he exited the bathroom and poked his head through the\ndoorway of the kitchen. Mack was shocked at the scene in front of\nhim. It appeared that Jesus had dropped a large bowl of some sort of\nbatter or sauce on the floor, and it was everywhere. It must have\nlanded close to Papa because the lower portion of her skirt and bare\nfeet were covered in the gooey mess. All three were laughing so hard\nthat Mack didn\u2019t think they were breathing.  Sarayu said something\nabout humans being clumsy and all three started roaring again.\nFinally, Jesus brushed past Mack and returned a minute later with a\nlarge basin of water and towels.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>I\nrealise that the Shack is a fictional story, but it makes a very\nimportant point; the humanness of Jesus did not mean that for him\nlife was free from mishaps or accidents. Jesus was completely\nsinless, but because he lived in a sinful world, everything he did\nwas not \u2018perfect\u2019 or \u2018successful.\u2019 I realise many will\nstruggle with what is being said here because we equate \u2018mistakes\u2019\nwith \u2018sin,\u2019 when they very different.  Jesus knew what it was\nlike to be disappointed, frustrated and angry. He did things that did\nnot always turn out in the way he hoped for. Often in the gospels you\nhear his frustration and disappointment.  Jesus\u2019 humanity teaches\nus that doing everything with perfect motives and in a perfect way\ndoes not guarantee perfect success or results. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nhad to learn to do things; on his first day in Joseph\u2019s carpenter\nshop, Jesus did not make a perfect wooden joint or a perfect table or\nchair, he had to learn his craft, learn from his mistakes because\nthat is what it means to be human.  This is the Jesus that God wants\nus to know and love, as a fellow human being who has shared in our\nfrustrations and disappointments, someone who understands what it\u2019s\nlike to live in an imperfect world</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Could\nI suggest that Jesus was too secure in his relationship with his\nfather to be a perfectionist. Perfectionism is rooted in pride.  \nBecause Jesus had a perfect relationship with his Father, and loved\nhis Father with a perfect love, and lived a life of complete\nsubmission to his Father\u2019s will, Jesus had no need to be a\nperfectionist.    What do I mean by that? </strong></p><p><strong>Some\nof us want to do everything perfectly, and when we don\u2019t we begin\nto come down on ourselves and beat ourselves up. Sometimes we do\nthings with pure motives, for the right reasons, as best as we know\nhow, and they end up in failure and disappointment.  Sometimes we are\noverwhelmed with feelings of failure or even self loathing because\nour best efforts amount to nothing.  We may have done something, even\nsomething for God, and it did not turn out the way we had hoped or\nexpected, we may live in fear of letting others down, or fear of\nfailure, or fear of being thought little of, so we develop a\nperfectionist attitude that drives us. The modern day psychological\nterm \u2018perfectionism,\u2019 is not something that affected Jesus. As\nour perfect example of humanity, Jesus teaches us that being secure\nin our relationship with the father keeps us safe from the cruel\nbondage of perfectionism.  Perfectionism is really an expression of\ninverted pride. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nlive in a day were their seems to be a \u2018pandemic of perfectionism.\u2019\nwere there is constant pressure \u2018on people to always be the best,\nto always achieve excellence.  Social media has helped create a world\nof unrealistic expectations that have dehumanised people to a glossy\ntwo dimensional fictional character that has nothing to do with their\ntrue selves.

For God to reveal himself in the complete vulnerability of\na baby would have been seen as a blasphemous shock, a scandal to both\nthe Jews and gentiles.

These words of Paul express what\nJesus did when he became a baby, and how he chose to live his life as\na human.</strong></p><p><strong>He\ndid not consider equality with God something to be grasped.  \u2018Christ\nbeing fully God, possessing the very nature of God and being fully\nequal to God in every respect, did not thereby insist on holding onto\nall the privileges and benefits of his position of equality with God\n[the Father]. He did not clutch or grasp his place of equality with\nthe father and all that this brought to him in such a way that He\nchoose the condescension and humiliation of the servant role he was\nbeing called to accept. He did not think of his status as something\nto be clung to or grasped. </strong></p><p><strong>As\na man, Jesus was divested of all self interest; He refused to use his\npower or glory to gain a reputation. Often when Jesus healed someone\nhe would say something like, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d He had no\ninterest in making a name for himself. He did not care about his\nreputation.  Because of our sinful habits we have formed over the\nyears, it is our natural inclination to be self protective, to avoid\nbeing vulnerable, but in Jesus we see that in emptying himself he\nbecame extremely vulnerable. The vulnerability in his humanity was\nnever inconsistent with God\u2019s original intention for mankind. If\nfact, the vulnerability that Jesus displayed was a natural expression\nof perfect humanity. For it is through our vulnerabilities we\ndiscover our ability to love and care for others.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nhis birth, Jesus let go of all the power, prestige and position, and\nbecame a vulnerable weak dependent baby.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nbirth narrative of the gospels are stories that exalt vulnerability,\nthey teach us that </strong><strong>being\nhuman is tied to our ability to embrace a God ordained vulnerability,\nthat will make </strong><strong>dependence</strong><strong>\nupon him essential and natural. Let me give you some facts about the\nvulnerabilities around Jesus\u2019 birth.  </strong></p><p><strong>a.\nMary was a teenager who conceived outside marriage. Think of the\nshame and stigma there must have been for Jesus\u2019 mother, and for\nJesus. </strong></p><p><strong>b.\nRegistering for the census must have been a very painful act, not\nonly because doing so was inconvenient, but because it was a reminder\nthat while God's people, Israel, were in the land of promise, they\nwere not free; they were under the rule of a pagan power. A Roman\nlaw, made by a pagan potentate, compelled the Israelites to comply.</strong></p><p><strong>Also\nphysically this was bound to be painful for Mary. She was heavily\npregnant an arduous journey of 70 miles!!! The Saviour of the world\ntravelling in his mothers womb. The King of Kings travelling in his\nmothers womb. How safe was that journey? Did you know there is no\nmention of a donkey in the Christmas story</strong></p><p><strong>The\nbirth of Jesus was welcomed into the world by a group of shepherds,\nbasically ignorant and uneducated. They were unskilled. The work of a\nshepherd was generally given to children to do because it was so\nsimple. It didn't take any particular talent. They had no trade and\nwere the lowest paid. By virtue of the necessity of caring for sheep\nseven days a week, they lived in some level of violation of Mosaic\nLaw. Many commentators believe.  They couldn't maintain the Sabbath\nthe way the Sabbath should have been maintained. So not only were\nthese shepherds looked on as the \"lowest of the low\" they\nwere also seen as outcasts because they violated the Jewish Laws. If\nyou read Jewish literature written from the birth of Jesus over the\nnext hundred years or so they shepherds were seen as more and more\ndespised. In fact, it wasn't long after this that they were began to\nbe seen as unreliable, untrustworthy, unsavoury characters who were\nlargely suspected of stealing sheep and doing all kinds of illegal\nthings. Yet these were the first to hear about the birth of the\nsaviour of the world </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me to be more human and vulnerable . </strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan Leviticus 24:1-26:13</p>",

This passage has caused a\nlot of debate, but it is unique because it is the only passage that\naddresses the growth of Jesus. Being fully human, meant that Jesus\nneeded to grow, to mature and to learn.  In some sense this incident\nfrom Jesus' boyhood helps us see how Jesus became the type of man he\nwas.

However, that is not the case. He had to learn how\nto walk, talk, go to the bathroom, he had to learn how to read and\nwrite, he may have got his spellings or maths wrong at times.  He had\nto learn how to build relationships, to read social cues and customs.\nAs a man he needed to learn how to relate to God as his father.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nare told by Luke, \"Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for\nthe feast of the Passover.\" All male Jews were required to\nattend at the Temple three times in the year, at Passover, Pentecost\nand the Feast of Tabernacles (Ex. 23:14-17). The Mishnah expressly\nexempts women from the obligation (Haggai 1:1), but some rabbis\nappear to have thought they should go up and some, of course, did.\nAttendance at all three festivals was difficult with Jews scattered\nall over the Roman world and beyond, but many made the effort once a\nyear. It was the custom of Joseph and Mary to go up at Passover, the\nfeast that commemorated the deliverance of the nation from Egypt (Ex.\n12).\" This was an extremely joyous and exciting time in the life\nof a Jew; it was the highlight of their religious festivals.</strong></p><p><strong>Jerusalem\nwould have been crowded. How large the number of worshippers was, may\nbe gathered from Josephus, who records that, when Cestius requested\nthe high-priest to make a census, in order to convince Nero of the\nimportance of Jerusalem and of the Jewish nation, the number of lambs\nslain was found to be 256,500, which, at the lowest calculation of\nten persons to every sacrificial lamb, would give a population of\n2,565,000.</strong></p><p><strong>The\n12th year was the final year of preparation for a lad before he\nentered full participation into the religious life of the synagogue.\nUp until that time his parents, especially his father, taught him the\ncommandments of the law.

Luke 2:41,52   \nHave you ever thought that Jesus needed grace? We may struggle with\nthe concept that Jesus needed grace just as much as we need grace.\nOften we fall into the trap of thinking that the only reason why we\nneed grace is because we are sinners, and there is nothing we can do\nto earn God's love. Grace is more an attribute of God than a response\nto our sin. It is the essence of the fatherhood of God. Grace is the\nunconditional, and expressed acceptance of someone else despite their\nnational identity, ethnic grouping, cultural traditions, family\nbackground, religious preference, social standing, personality,\neccentricity or sinful behaviour. We must remember that Jesus was\nsinless, but being sinless did not make his Father love him any more.\nHis father accepted his sinless life as a substitute for our sinful\nlives. Jesus always did the things that pleased his father, but his\nlove for His son was unconditional. Experiencing the grace of God led\nto real growth. Because Jesus had no pride in his heart he was\nresponsive to the grace of his Father. Jesus grew because he knew\nthat his father loved him unconditionally.

I understand that here Jesus was only 12 years old and had\nlots to learn, however, all through his life on earth Jesus was\nteachable. How do I know that? Because being teachable is a posture\nof the heart that come from humility. Read John 7:16 NIV  \u201cMy\nteaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me.\u2019 You\ncould say, \u2018Being unteachable is like trying to play catch with\nyour hands in your pocket.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nwas focused on his Father.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nMary and Joseph found him in the temple Jesus was surprised. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Why\nwere you searching for me</strong></span><strong>\u201d\nhe asked. \u201c</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>Didn\u2019t\nyou know I had to be in my Father\u2019s house?\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n[or about my Father\u2019s business.]\u2019  The way Luke describes how\nMary and Joseph searched is referring to their mental attitude. The\nsearch was full of doubt and mental agony. It must have been\nparticularly distressing for them to realise that Jesus was missing.\nIt is understandable that they were so wrapped up in their own pain\nthat they could not see that there was nothing wrong with what the\nboy did in staying at the temple. Their rationale is irrational:\nbecause they suffered, they assumed him wrong.</strong></p><p><strong>It\nis not that they did not understand Christ's statement in an academic\nsense; it is just that they are so out of fellowship with him that\nthey will not accept his conclusion. To accept his conclusion is to\nadmit they are wrong, and that is just something that they will not\ndo. One or the other of them had to be wrong; it was not Christ. One\nof the greatest surrenders of pride is to admit that you have caused\nyour own pain; that is what Joseph and Mary are struggling with. Make\nno mistake the accusation of Joseph and Mary is completely unfair. At\nthis time they didn\u2019t get him or understand him. Despite that, he\nmaintained his focus. Parents will not always get or understand their\nchildren and that has to be okay. Sometimes to maintain a spiritual\nfocus can be very difficult and stressful.   </strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus was growing up as a boy, the people of Israel had developed a\nwrong concept of God. God was someone who was far away, someone who\ndid not care, someone who hadn't spoken to the nation for 400 years.\nPeoples' perception of God was that He imposed rules and regulations\non them. Judaism had become a legalistic religion with no love or\ncompassion and people where used to living at a distance from Him.\nHere we have a 12 year old boy calling this God his father, someone\nclose, someone who cared, someone whom he could trust, someone he\ncould relate to, someone who loved him and whom he could love back.\nJesus' view of God as his father was the antithesis to how everyone\nelse saw God. This would have really challenged the Jewish mind-set.</strong></p><p><strong>Growth\nis linked to a person's experience of God as their father. When we\nare feeling insecure, and are hounded with a bad self-image we will\nnot grow or mature as people. It is only when we are feeling secure\nand accepted that we will have the potential for real growth. That is\nwhy in the 'Lord's Prayer' Jesus begins by expressing our need to\nexperience God as father.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nwas deliberately submissive.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nNIV tells us in verse 51 \u2018Then he went down to Nazareth with them\nand was obedient to them.\u2019 </strong></p><p><strong>The\nproblem is that the word obedient can miss what the text is saying.\nSomeone can be \u2018obedient,\u2019 but in their hearts not be submissive,\nhowever, it is more difficult to be submissive and not be obedient.\nThe word that Luke uses carries the idea of having an attitude of\ndeep respect and humility.

On\noccasions Jesus did display aspects of his divine nature, for example\nwhen he was transfigured, or when walked on water, or when he forgave\nsin, for only God can forgive sin; but for the most part, Jesus lived\nas an ordinary man who had a life that was empowered by the Holy\nSpirit.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nhumanity of Jesus teaches us how the Holy Spirit wants to relate to\nus.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nthe Old Testament the Holy Spirit came upon people for a specific\nperiod of time with a specific purpose. For example when Saul became\nKing he was anointed by the Spirit. We are told, \u2018When they came\nthere to the hill, there was a group of prophets to meet him; then\nthe Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.\u2019 1\nSamuel 10:10. Then because of Saul's\u2019 disobedience we are told.\n\u2018But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and a distressing\nSpirit from the Lord troubled him!\u2019 1 Samuel 16:14. That is why in\nPsalm 51 David prayed \u2018Take not your Holy Spirit from me.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>But\nin the humanity of Jesus we see that we were created to live a life\nof dependence on the Father and empowered by the Spirit; a life of\ncontinual dependence on the Holy Spirit. We are told in John 3:34\nthat Jesus had the Spirit in his life without limit, and athough\nJesus\u2019 experience of the Spirit was greater than ours, but that\ndoes not mean that Jesus ceases to be our example or prototype of\nwhat it means to live as Spirit filled people.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that my humanity was created for the life and work of the\nSpirit.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Numbers 15:22-16:50.</p>",

During this period\nin the wilderness Jesus had  experience his father\u2019s discipline. \nDeuteronomy 8 was in his mind, Verses 2-5 read.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Remember\nhow the LORD your God led you all the way in the desert these forty\nyears; to humble you and to test you in order to know what was in\nyour heart, whether or not you would keep his commands. He humbled\nyou, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which\nneither you nor your fathers had known, to teach you that man does\nnot live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth\nof the LORD. Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not\nswell during these forty years. Know then in your heart that as a man\ndisciplines his son, so the LORD your God disciplines you.\u2019\nDeuteronomy 8:2-3. Where the People of Israel failed in the\nwilderness, Jesus succeeded.</strong></p><p><strong>Often\nwhen it comes to the whole area of discipline we have muddled\nthinking. We are inclined to see discipline as a kind of punishment\nfor sin. However in the mind of God, discipline is not a divine\nreaction to sin, but an aid to growth and maturity. As a son Jesus\nnever sinned, but as a son he required discipline. The word\ndiscipline simply means to educate, to teach. The Greek word for\ndiscipline paideia was used to describe \"the process of\neducating man into his true form, the real and genuine human nature.\"\n</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nhad a divinely appointed encounter in the wilderness. Jesus was\nlearning that cost and suffering were part of the life he was called\nto. His wilderness hunger, loneliness and temptation were consistent\nwith the love and will of his Father.</strong></p><p><strong>Temptation.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword Luke uses for Temptations in 4:13 is the Greek word peirasmos\nwhich is also often translated test or trial. It is important that we\ngrasp the relationship between these two words.</strong></p><p><strong>A.\nSometimes it is difficult to distinguish the difference between a\ntemptation and a trial. It is not always easy to know if the\nunpleasant circumstances of our lives are being orchestrated by\nSatan, or sent by God, or is God using the activity of Satan to\nfulfil his purposes?</strong></p><p><strong>B.\nThe intentions of Satan behind temptation and the intention of God\nbehind testing are the complete opposite. Satan tempts to destroy\nwhile God tests to develop, grow and mature us.</strong></p><p><strong>C.\nSometimes the temptation and the testing come together. The thing\nSatan wants to use to destroy us is the very same thing God wants to\nuse to develop us. This is what happened to Jesus in the wilderness.\nIt is also how Paul understood his thorn in the flesh. Look at what\nPaul says. </strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Therefore,\nin order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in\nmy flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.</strong><sup><strong>\n</strong></sup><strong>Three\ntimes I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to\nme my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in\nweakness.\u2019Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my\nweaknesses, so that Christ\u2019s power may rest on me.\u2019 </strong></p><p><strong>D.\nThe outcome of the temptation/trial depends on how we respond to the\ntemptation/trial. The attitudes and responses we need to overcome the\nseductive nature of temptation are similar to the attitudes and\nresponses we need to cope with trials. Both temptation and trials\nrequire us to have a growing dependence upon God and an increasing\nsubmission to his will.</strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme conclude with a quote.</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>When\nthe world did not end as Jesus himself had said it would, his\nfollowers stopped expecting so much from God or from themselves. They\nhung a wooden cross on the wall and settled back into their more or\nless comfortable routines, remembering their once passionate devotion\nto God the way they remembered the other enthusiasms of their youth.\nLittle by little, Christians became devoted to their comforts\ninstead: the soft couch, the flannel sheets, the leg of lamb roasted\nwith rosemary. These things made them feel safe and cared for, if not\nby God, then by themselves. They decided there was no contradiction\nbetween being comfortable and being Christian, and before long it was\nvery hard to pick them out from the population at large. They no\nlonger distinguished themselves by their bold love for one another.\nThey did not get arrested for championing the poor. They blended in.\nThey avoided extremes. They decided to be nice instead of holy, and\nGod moaned out loud.\u201d  Barbara Brown Taylor.</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.redeemerwhitebear.org/pastors-blog/what-is-lent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>https://www.redeemerwhitebear.org/pastors-blog/what-is-lent</strong></a><strong>\naccessed 30/04/2025</strong></p><p><strong>Are\nwe willing to go to the desert and stay </strong><em><strong>as\nlong as it takes</strong></em><strong>\nfor the Spirit to shape our heart, understanding and mission?

It is so important that we grapple with this issue because\nlike Jesus we are human and like Jesus we need to take up our cross.\nI fully understand that For Jesus the cross he carried  was of much\nmore horrible, horrendous,  significance and important than the\n\u2018cross,\u2019 we will have ever have to carry, however, like Jesus,\nour truest humanity is most clearly displayed through a \u2019cruciform,\nlife, that is a life that is shaped by a cross..</strong></p><p><strong>We\nare going too learn that to take up your cross is certainly about\nobedience, devotion and sacrifice, but I think the most important\naspect for us about taking up our cross, is it is God way of\nrevealing his heart to the world. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nare going to begin by thinking about Jesus in the garden of\nGathsemane. I want to  make three introductory remarks which will\nhelp us.</strong></p><p><strong>a.\nGathsemane is \u2018holy grounds. These are probable the most intimate\nand most intense moments in Jesus\u2019 life.</strong></p><p><strong>b.\n Gathsemane is where we need to engage in a battle to maintain our\nhumanity. Here was an other opportunity for Jesus to turn \u2018stone\ninto bread,\u2019 to take things into his own hands, to become king\nwithout a cross, to allow his deity to overshadow his humanity.  But\ninstead he entered into an intense battle to maintain his humanity. \nIn Matthew 26:53 Jesus said.</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u2018Don\u2019t you realise that I could ask my Father for thousands of\nangels to protect us, and he would send them instantly.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>c.\nGathsemane is the gateway to a cruciform life. That is a life shaped\nby a cross</strong></p><p><strong>At\nsome stage in the life of every Christian there needs to be a\nGethsemane moment, a significant crisis of commitment where they\ndecide what kind of relationship they want to have with God. How\nwould you feel if God took your cross from you? If God asked you not\nto carry your cross any more? These may be a strange questions,\nhowever, if it happened we would be unable to follow Jesus    </strong></p><p><strong>At\nsome stage in the life of every Christian, there needs to be a\nGethsemane moment where the decision to enter into deeper devotion\nand absolute surrender to God is made. </strong></p><p><strong>At\nsome stage in the life of every Christian there needs to be a\nGethsemane moment where the most important questions of life are\nanswered. It is in the crisis of Gethsemane that the essence of our\nlives is revealed.   As Jesus suffered in the garden of Gethsemane\nhis humanity was threatened, would he remain a man who needed to live\nin submission and surrender to his Father? Or would he choose to be\nmore than human, and refuse submission and surrender?  Gethsemane is\nwhere we fight to preserve our humanity and integrity. The crossroads\nof Gethsemane is where our past can be wasted, our priorities are\nchallenged and our destiny is threatened.</strong></p><p><strong>Gethsemane\nis a place of choice. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nknow from Luke 22:39 that Jesus had visited Gethsemane before, he was\nfamiliar with it, but on this occasion Gethsemane was much more than\na geographical location. It was a place of massive spiritual\nsignificance, a symbol of Jesus\u2019 spiritual choice. It would have\nbeen very easy for Jesus to walk away from this garden conflict. He\nwas God, he had the power to protect and defend himself, but as a\nhuman he needed to go through the pain of completely surrendering his\nlife to his father, in the knowledge that he would have give up the\ncontrol over the consequences of his surrender. Mark tells us that he\nwould be \u2018betrayed into the hand of sinners.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>There\nis something in all of us that wants to avoid Gethsemane, we are\nhappy with a \u2018functional\u2019 faith, we love God and we are willing\nto serve, but go to Gethsemane? Where God might ask more than we are\nwilling to give, that scares us, it unsettles us, and like the\ndisciples we sleep, not realising that sleeping in a place of\ncommitment like Gethsemane could lead to denial or betrayal. Our\nGethsemane will never be as difficult or painful as Jesus\u2019.\nHowever, it is essential.  There are times in all our lives when we\nneed to visit and revisit Gethsemane, where we decide how we want to\nlive for God, and decide if we are prepared to lay down our lives to\nfulfil the purposes of God. Gethsemane is the difference between a\nmediocre religion and whole-hearted following.  Gethsemane is the\ndifference between maintenance and maturity.  </strong></p><p><strong>Let\njust say that for us Gethsemane is not a regular experience, but it\nwill happen at times of crisis and challenge. </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you for the cross you want me to carry</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Deuteronomy 4:1-6:15</p>",

He begins with the word </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>Abba.</strong></span><strong>\n This is the only time the word Abba is found in the gospels. And it\nis the only time we find it used in a prayer by Jesus.  Many of us\nhave been brought up being taught that Abba was an Aramaic meaning\ndaddy. However, Abba was not merely a word used by young children. It\nwas also the word that Jewish children used for their parents after\nthey were fully grown. Abba was a mature, yet affectionate way for\nadults to speak to their fathers.\u201d Abba is profoundly respectful;\nthe deferential language of the Servant reporting to His God, yet at\nthe same time is deeply intimate in a way that no other mortal could\nhave used the word. Respect and familiarity seem to come together in\nAbba. In the patriarchal societies of antiquity, the father figure is\nendowed with two particular characteristics. On the one hand, the\nfather rules as head of the household and the person to whom most\nrespect is due, having absolute authority over his family. On the\nother hand, he has the responsibility of guarding, supporting and\nhelping the other members. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\u2019\nuse of the word Abba is extremely significant, for it communicates\nJesus\u2019 perception of his Father. He refused to allow this\nheart-breaking experience to alter his perception of his Father. In\nthe agony of his heart he still had a deep love and respect for his\nfather. So the \u2018Abba\u2019 word tells us how Jesus is approaching this\ntime of prayer. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nthis prayer Jesus was honest. As a man Jesus did not want to die a\ndeath which was the result of the wrath of God upon the sin of the\nworld. Jesus referred to the Cross as the \"hour\" and the\n\"cup.\" The first expression includes everything involved in\nthe Cross. The \"cup\" figuratively spoke of God's judgment\nin the Cross.  Yet His desire to obey his father was greater than his\ndesire to avoid the cross.</strong></p><p><strong>It\nwas a prayer of submission. Submission is not about gritting your\nteeth and clinching your fists. It is not about determination, and\nbeing strong minded. Rather, submission is the consequences of\nallowing God to change your heart; it is the natural result of\nauthentic fellowship with God.  The word the bible uses for\nsubmit/submission was a military term; to arrange in order file/rank,\nto get in order under someone else.</strong></p><p><strong>One\nof the fascinating that comes out of this incident, is unanswered\nprayer made the  cross possible.

For many the phrase \u2018Take up your cross,\u2019 has\nbecome a clich\u00e9 which has been robed of understanding and power So\nwe want to try and explore what Jesus meant when he said  </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018</strong></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\nwhoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my\ndisciple.\u2019 </strong></span><strong>Luke\n14:27. Jesus was very emphatic here, he did not give any wriggle\nroom.</strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme make a few observations</strong></p><p><strong>Depending\non what version of the bible you read, the phrase 'take up your\ncross' is either found five or six times. Matthew 10:38, 16:24, Mark\n8:34, Luke 9:23,  and Luke 14:27. Many of the older translations\ninclude the phrase in Mark 10:21 as part of Jesus response to the\nRich Young Ruler, while the more modern translations don't. </strong></p><p><strong>There\nis an intrinsic between the cross of Christ and the cross we are told\nwe must carry. On a number of occasions when Jesus predicted his\ndeath he went on to speak about the cross we must carry. Matthew\n16:21 </strong><strong>From\nthen on Jesus began to tell his disciples plainly </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>that\nit was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem, and that he would suffer\nmany terrible things at the hands of the elders, the leading priests,\nand the teachers of religious law. He would be killed, but on the\nthird day he would be raised from the dead.</strong></span><strong>\n Then in verse 24 we read  \u2018Then Jesus said to his disciples,  </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cIf\nany of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way,\ntake up your cross, and follow me.</strong></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nsee also Mark 8:31-3 and Luke 9:21-23.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nimportance of this cannot be overstated. In the thinking of Jesus the\nlink between the cross he died on and the cross we have to carry is\nessential for our understanding of who Jesus is. The cross we have to\ncarry enable us to identify with Jesus and understand how he viewed\nlife and how it should be lived. We need to remember that Jesus did\n\u2018not\u2019 lay down his life on the cross, but that he took up hiss\ncross because he had always lived a  \u2018laid down,\u2019 life. In taking\nup our cross we are entering into the fellowship of his suffering </strong><strong>If\nyou look carefully at every context in which Jesus uses the phrase,\n\u2018take up your cross,\u2019  it is in the context of difficult\nrelationships. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nMatthew 10:34-37 Jesus is speaking about difficult relationships, and\nhow the demands of the Kingdom can put great strain on family\nrelationships. Then he says in 10:38 </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'And\nanyone who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of\nme.'</strong></span><strong>\nThis is similar to the </strong>\n\n<strong>context\nin Luke 14:27 </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'And\nwhosoever does not carry his cross, and come after me, cannot be my\ndisciple.' </strong></span><strong>The\nmain difference being between Matthew\u2019s and Luke\u2019s quote, is that\n</strong>\n\n<strong>in\nMatthew 10 Jesus was speaking to the twelve, while in Luke 14 He is\nspeaking to the crowds. The references to \u2018take up your cross\u2019 in\nMatthew 16:24, Mark 8:34 and Luke 9:23 are all in the context of\nPeter's confession and rebuke of Jesus, although Luke does not\nmention that Peter rebuked Jesus. However this was a time of personal\ntension between the two. If we include Mark 10:21, that too was in\nthe context of a strained relationship between the Rich Young Ruler\nand Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe think of Jesus taking up his own cross, that was to mend broken\nrelationships between God and man, so as we try to understand what\n'taking up your cross really means, we need to keep in mind the\ncontexts in which Jesus spoke this command.  Taking up our cross has\nno redemptive power as far as sin is concerned, however, those who\ntake up their cross will be more equipped to build, sustain and heal\nrelationships.

The crosses we are to carry should be tangible symbols\nof God love for the world.  Or to put it an other way,  it is not\npossible to carry your cross and not be loving, forgiving and\ngracious.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nread some fascinating verses in Matthew 27:39-42 </strong><strong>39\n</strong><strong>Those\nwho passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying,\n\u201cYou who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three\ndays, save yourself!

It\nis so easy for any of us to become separated from our crosses by\nwanting to defend ourselves from others. Sometimes we need to ask God\nfor the courage to have \u2018a staying on the cross\u2019 attitude.\nSometimes holding onto your cross can be more difficult than taking\nit up. </strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhat is the cross we have to carry?</strong></p><p><strong>As\nwe have previously said we must not tum the cross that Jesus was\nspeaking of here into something it isn't. Many people think that a\ncross is any trial or hardship you are going through, such as, a\nhealth problem, a disability, bereavement, or being single. 'That's\nmy cross,' we say, but this is not what Jesus meant. The </strong>\n\n<strong>problem\nwith this understanding is that most of the pain we go through in\nlife is not of our own choosing. I didn't wake up one morning and\nthink Cerebral Palsy is the cross for me, so l chose my disability.\nNo! </strong>\n\n<strong>When\nit comes to most of the trials and difficulties in life, we don't\nhave a choice, but when it comes to taking up our cross we do have a\nchoice.  The cross in Jesus' day was an instrument of torture and\nexecution, pure and simple. There wasn't any figurative use of\n'cross' as a 'burden' or 'trial' in those days.</strong></p><p><strong>Taking\nup our cross is us choosing to live the way Jesus died<br/>\nThe cross\nthat Jesus is speaking about may not lead to physical death, in fact\nthere may not be anything physical to it. What Jesus is referring </strong>\n\n<strong>to\nis the heart attitude of a cross bearer. Or to put it in the form of\na question;</strong></p><p><strong>What\nkind of heart attitudes did Jesus display as he carried His cross?\nJesus was expressing an attitude of love, forgiveness humility and\n</strong>\n\n<strong>submission\nas he bowed to, and suffered in the will of God. The attitudes and\nmotives Jesus needed to die on the cross, are the same attitudes and\nmotives we need for life.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me to show through life the same attitudes Jesus showed through\nhis death,</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Deuteronomy 16:9-19:21</p>",

Many people think that to deny yourself\nmeans that we must feel bad about ourselves, we must loathe\n</strong>\n\n<strong>ourselves,\nwe suffer from a poor self image. However, those who think this way\nare unable to deny themselves. Denying yourself is an </strong>\n\n<strong>expression\nof security not insecurity, it is a volitional choice of our wills,\nnot an emotional response to the world around us.

To deny yourself is to choose humility over pride. To deny\nyourself is to choose to obey the will of God irrespective of the\npersonal cost and pain.

The scary thing is\nthat the words of Jesus infer that someone can loose their life/soul\nbefore they die. Those who are lost continue to perish after death in\nthe same way those who have eternal life have it before death</strong></p><p><strong>It\nis quite amazing to me that some evangelical commentators </strong>\n\n<strong>understand\nthe word saved in this context as referring to obtaining eternal\nsalvation.</strong></p><p><strong>'There\nis no salvation apart from cross-bearing.' (Boice, Christ's Call To\nDiscipleship, p 36).</strong></p><p><strong>I\nthink to interpret the word save in this context, as referring to\nsalvation from sin in this context is wrong for a number of reasons.</strong></p><p><strong>Eternal\nsalvation is not conditioned elsewhere in the Bible upon self-denial\nand cross bearing. </strong></p><p><strong>Eternal\nsalvation is not something which we buy or earn, it is a free gift.</strong></p><p><strong>Those\nbeing addressed here are believers, not unbelievers. </strong></p><p><strong>Recompense\naccording to one's deeds is a not a salvation </strong>\n\n<strong>concept.\nRather, it is a reward concept.  </strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhat does it mean to loose your life and save your life?</strong></p><p><strong>All\nbelievers have eternal life. However, only self-denying believers\nwill </strong>\n\n<strong>realise\nthe full potential of eternal life (John 10:10). A 'saved life' is\nthe glory of a life lived for God.</strong></p><p><strong>To\nloose one's life is to play it safe; it is to decide against the way\nof the cross and its confrontation with the status quo. It is to\ndecide for what is safe, it is a deep concern for self-interest.\n\"Survival at all costs,\" is a flawed philosophy by which to\nlive. 'Be faithful to Christ no matter what the cost,' is the\nphilosophy Jesus' disciples came to live by. We are made in such\naway, that when we live a self-obsessed fife, something with in us\ndies.

As we have said, Jesus is primarily\naddressing his disciples. So how are we to understand what Jesus is\nsaying here?</strong></p><p><strong>I\nthink Jesus is using what I would call 'ironic hyperbole.' What do I\nmean? Jesus is saying something like this. 'If you were to gain the\n</strong>\n\n<strong>whole\nworld, and everything that is in the world, and forfeit your life,\nyour soul, and avoid your cross and the purposes of God for your\nlife, then you will gain nothing.' </strong></p><p><strong>In\nMatthew 16:26 the word \"Forfeit\" Greek zemioo, to affect\nwith damage or to do damage to, to suffer injury, to suffer loss, to\nsustain damage, to forfeit or to fine. It means to experience the\nloss of something, with implication of undergoing hardship or\nsuffering.  The word is found 339 other times in the New Testament,\nand never refers to eternal destruction. So when Jesus speaks about\n'forfeiting our lives in this context. He is not speaking about\neternal judgement, but rather the self-harm we inflict upon ourselves\nwhen we refuse the way of the cross, for an easier option.</strong></p><p><strong>Why\nis it essential that we find life by loosing it? If our mindset is\nthe </strong>\n\n<strong>antithesis\nto the way of the cross, then we will never be ourselves. We will\nbecome caricatures of our true selves who have reduced life to an\nexpression of egocentric selfish living. The crosses we need to carry\nshowcase the glories of humanity as God intended it to be. The\nattitudes needed to carry our cross conform us into the image of\nJesus and display God\u2019s original intention for human kind.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nconcludes his teaching on taking up your cross with the words </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'For\nthe Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his\n</strong></span>\n\n<span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>angels\nand then he will reward each person according to what he has done.' </strong></span><strong>I\nfind this very challenging.

Nor did his death, burial and resurrection make him more\nhuman, or less human. From his birth, to this present day Jesus was\nand is completely human. However, in his humanity, Jesus, through his\nexperience of death, burial and resurrection is able to teach us\nthings about our humanity that he was unable to teach us before his\ndeath and resurrection. Or to put it another way, one of the lessons\nthe resurrection of Jesus teaches us is what it means to live as\nhealthy human being, in the victory of God. in a sinful fallen world.\nWhat does it mean to live in the \u2018power of the resurrection? How\ndoes God want to display his power and glory through our humanity?\nWhat does the power that raised Jesus from the dead look like in\neveryday life?   The resurrected life of Jesus as it is portrayed in\nthe gospels, explains and demonstrate the purpose and power of the\ncross. You could say that the record of Jesus life between his\nresurrection and ascension is an example for those who lives have\nbeen transformed by his death on the cross.  </strong></p><p><strong>We\nwant to look at Jesus\u2019 appearances after his resurrection as it is\nrecorded by John in his gospel. John records more resurrection\nappearances than any other gospel. When John speaks about Jesus\n\u2018appearing\u2019 to his disciples he uses the word phaneroo \n\u2018appeared, this term conveys the showing of one\u2019s character,\nmotivations or intentions, and it comes from the verb phain\u014d, which\nmeans \u201cto shine.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\u2019\nresurrection teaches us that mankind has a new way to relate to God.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus was raised from the dead the whole belief system of the\ndisciples was challenged, and made completely obsolete. The followers\nof Jesus had been brought up good Jews who went to the temple in\nJerusalem at least three times a year to make sacrifices for sin. For\nthe early followers of Jesus the temple and the sacrificial system\nwas the centre of their lives. Now Jesus had risen from the dead, he\nhad become the sacrifice for sin; he was the Lamb of God that took\naway the sin of the world. Can you imagine how difficult this must\nhave been for the first disciples? The beliefs that their nation had\nheld for thousands of years had now been done away with. And the only\nway mankind could relate to God was by receiving God\u2019s mercy and\ngrace. </strong></p><p><strong>Unintentionally\nfor many people today, their Christian experience has become an\nexpression of bloodless sacrificing where they attempt to appease God\nand win his approval. We all understand the dangers of a \u2018prosperity\ngospel,\u2019 were people are deceived into making sacrifices in order\nto get something back.  If you were to boil the tenants of the\nprosperity gospel down to their basic components you will discover\nthat any one of us can live our lives and relate to God on the same\npremise. </strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme illustrate. Someone lives for God the best they know how, they\ncross all the t\u2019s and dot all the i\u2019s. That person may be tempted\nto think, \u2018I have done my best to live for God, God owes me, I\ndeserve God\u2019s blessing.\u2019 We may never actually say those words\nout loud, but at times we can think or feel that way.</strong></p><p><strong>To\nexperience the power of the resurrection is to understand that I can\nnever appease God, and I need to accept the fact that God will only\ndeal with me on the basis of grace. The resurrection of Jesus shouts\nto the world that the sacrificial system is over and no matter how\ngood I am or how much I sacrifice; God will still owe me nothing, but\nhe has chooses to show me grace.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that the resurrection of Jesus shows us that you have\naccepted the price Jesus paid</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Deuteronomy 23:15-27:10</p>",

Between his resurrection and ascension the main focus of Jesus\nwas one of restoring and reassuring.

The life of Jesus clearly demonstrates\nthat the power of the resurrection is completely free from any kind\nof abusive or controlling tendencies, and will empower someone with\nthe humility to bow and help those who hearts have been crushed with\nguilt and shame.

In some way it\u2019s\n\u2018strangeness,\u2019 makes it difficult to relate to.</strong></p><p><strong>c.\nPerhaps the main reason why we find it difficult to engage with it is\nthat it is easier to live with an un-ascended Jesus. We will come\nback to this at the end. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nincarnation, death and resurrection are only complete and effective\nbecause of the ascension of Jesus. The ascension of Jesus is\nsomething we don\u2019t often we think about or talk about. Someone has\ncalled it \u2018The forgotten act of Christ.\u2019  We can focus on what\nJesus did do while he was here on earth, or we can get excited and\nexorcised about His return. [Both of these things are important.]\nHowever, between these two points we have the ascension of Jesus,\nwhich can be overlooked or ignored. It is essential that we take some\ntime to think through the ascension of Jesus and the implications for\nour lives. The ascension had a profound impact on the disciples.</strong></p><p><strong>Up\nto the moment that Jesus ascended to heaven, the disciples seemed to\nbe puzzled, trying to figure it all out. Luke 24:50-53 tells us.\n\u2018When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up\nhis hands and blessed them. While he was blessing them, he left them\nand was taken up into heaven. Then they worshipped him and returned\nto Jerusalem with great joy. And they stayed continually at the\ntemple, praising God.\u2019 </strong></p><p><strong>Look\nat how Luke describes the affects of the ascension.  \u2018They\nworshipped him\u2019, they experienced \u2018great joy,\u2019 and they\n\u2019continually stayed at the temple, praising God.\u2019  A proper\nunderstanding of the ascension will produce great joy in our hearts.\nThis may seem to be a strange response because Jesus is leaving them,\nhe is going away. However, these early Christians had grasped the\nfull meaning of the ascension, and great joy was their appropriate\nresponse. </strong></p><p><strong>2.\nThe ascension of Jesus is the catalyst for the church.</strong></p><p><strong>It\nwould be difficult to overstate the significance of the fact that the\nbook of Acts begins with the ascension. The ascension made the church\npossible. The ascension is a statement that says Jesus is ready to do\nsomething new and different on the earth. The ascension is a\nuniversal declaration of Jesus\u2019 intention to redefine His world\nthrough the life of his church.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nare often inclined to reduce the ascension of Jesus as him leaving\nthe earth and going into heaven. But it is a lot more than that.\nAscension is really coronation language, it carries the idea on\nenthronement, Queen Elisabeth ascended her throne.</strong></p><p><strong>Luke\ntells us that \u2018He was taken up into a cloud.\u2019 This is very\nimportant because to people, like the first disciples, who had an\nunderstanding of the Old Testament, the cloud would have be a symbol\nof God\u2019s presence and glory. </strong></p><p><a href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Dan%207.13-14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Daniel\n7:13-14</strong></a><strong>,\u201cI\nsaw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there\ncame one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and\nwas presented before him. </strong><strong><strong>And\nto him was given dominion and glory and a KINGDOM, that all peoples,\nnations, and language should serve him; his dominion is an\neverlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his KINGDOM one\nthat shall not be destroyed.\u201d</strong></strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>In\nActs 2:32-35, Peter says these words:-</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>God\nhas raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it.\nExalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the\npromised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.\nFor David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said,\u201c\u2018The Lord\nsaid to my Lord: \u201cSit at my right hand until I make your enemies a\nfootstool for your feet.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>This\ntruth should produce in us a great confidence. We can look at the\nchurch and become discouraged, but we need to remember that Jesus has\nascended, he sits on a throne and his reign is everlasting, and his\nvictory is eternal.

When Jesus sat on the throne of heaven he lost nothing of\nhis humanity. He could of discarded his humanity, but maybe Jesus\nlikes being human. He is God, and he has all the attributes of The\nDevine, but he is as human as he was on earth. In His humanity he\nstill identifies with our humanity. Some imagine that Christ shed\nhimself of his humanity and returned to being a completely spiritual\nbeing when he went back to Heaven. But this is false. The ascension\ncreates a paradigm shift. The truth is not that Jesus became a baby\nat Christmas, and then 33 years later came the resurrection and\nascension and then he stopped being a man. Jesus is still as human\ntoday as he was on earth. He still has a male body with all it\ndistinctive parts. The resurrection demonstrates the incarnation is\npermanent not temporary. See 1 Timothy 2:5. Philippians 2:5-8.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nretains a human body and we will be like him. And that means that\nlike him, we will have bodies for eternity. We will be transformed,\nwe will be different, but we will still have bodies. Our eternal\nfuture will be a physical, bodily future. It is very common for\nChristians to pit the \u2018spiritual\u2019 against the \u2018physical\u2019, as\nif the spiritual were somehow more holy than the physical. We think\nof redemption in terms of escaping from our bodies.  Some Christians\nare Gnostic in their thinking, they believe that our bodies are\ncontemptible or to be despised. A lot of psychological issues people\nhave regarding their bodies are rooted in |Gnostic theology which\nsays that we are just people trapped in a body, and that someday we\nwill be body free. You will always have a body, now you will get a\nbody that is like his body. To dismiss our bodies is to think\numbilically. Listen to these word Hebrews 10:5 Therefore, when Christ\ncame into the world, he said: \"Sacrifice and offering you did\nnot desire, but a body you prepared for me; In other words the bodies\nwe have been given have been bespokely designed to complement God\u2019s\nwill for our lives</strong></p><p><strong>4.\nThe ascension ensures that we have the authority to be the people God\nwants us to be.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nthe day of Jesus a victorious king would give gifts to his people to\ncelebrate his victory and enthronement. Acts 1:8 says:-</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>But\nyou will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you\nwill be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and\nto the ends of the earth.\u201d The gift of the Holy Spirit given to the\nchurch by King Jesus is to empower them to be his \u2018witnesses.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword  \u2019witness,\u2019 is a title given by God, to his servant in the\nbook of Isaiah. If you look at how Isaiah describes a \u2018witness\u2019\nit has more to do with the quality of the persons relationship with\nGod, than what he does.</strong></p><p><strong>Isaiah\n\t\t\t43:10</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>You\nare my witnesses,\u201d declares the Lord, \u201cand my servant whom I have\nchosen, that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he.\nBefore me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>Isaiah\n44:8</strong></p><p><strong>Fear\nnot, nor be afraid; have I not told you from of old and declared it?\nAnd you are my witnesses! Is there a God besides me? There is no\nRock; I know not any.\u201d </strong></p><p><strong>The\ntransforming power of the Spirit in our lives give us the godly\ncharacter needed in order to be authentic witnesses for Jesus. Any\nwitness for Jesus that does not flow from a character that is growing\nin holiness, because of the ongoing transformation of the Holy Spirit\nis a false witness. </strong></p><p><strong>5.\nThe ascension means we have the security and authority to bring the\nkingdom of God anywhere and everywhere.</strong></p><p><strong>Look\nat what Jesus said:- </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018In\nJerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the\nearth.\u201d </strong></span></p><p><strong>A\nlot of commentators understand this phrase as a geographical outline\nof the book. The church started in Jerusalem, spread to Judea,\nSamaria and then to Rome,  or the end of the earth. However,  when\nthe first disciples heard Jesus saying these words</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u2018in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the\nearth.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nthey would have probably have been shocked if not terrified.</strong></p><p><strong>Jerusalem,\na place where Jesus lost his life, a place were the combined\nreligious and political authorities had set themselves against Jesus\nand his cause.</strong></p><p><strong>Judea,\nthe place where the disciples had blown it. It was in Judea that they\nhad ran away, deserting Jesus.

For it is outside our comfort zones that we\nare more vulnerable and dependant on the life of the Spirit. What\nJesus was asking of these first disciples was not just to simply\ngather and \u2018rub each others backs\u2019 but was asking to be\nauthentic, transformed witnesses in the most precarious of places.\nThey could do this, not because they were strong and brave, and had\ndynamic personalities.  But because Jesus had ascended, he was the\nconquering King, who  gifted his church with the power of his Sprit. \n</strong></p><p><strong>Do\nyou remember when Jesus appeared to Mary after his resurrection?

Like many of the\nstories in the gospels this is very familiar and because it is\nfamiliar it has been reduced to a very familiar application. Let me\nexplain what I mean. </strong></p><p><strong>Many\napply this passage something like this. </strong></p><p><strong>1.\nJesus prayed all night before he made an important decision.</strong></p><p><strong>2.\nAfter he prayed all night he came to his disciples and chose twelve\ndisciples to become apostles.</strong></p><p><strong>3.Before\nany of us make any important decisions in life we should spend time\npraying about it.</strong></p><p><strong>This\napplication of this passage is completely legitimate and helpful,\nprayer should be a constant in our lives as it was in Jesus\u2019 life.\nLuke mentions prayer more than any other gospel, 21 times, 25 times\nin Acts he refers to prayer. As people whose lives depend on God we\nshould pray when we have to make important decisions; we should be\nseeking God\u2019s wisdom and strength as we seek to make the right\nchoices in life.</strong></p><p><strong>Having\nsaid that,  I am not too sure if this is the main lesson of this\npassage. Yes Jesus prayed then He called the twelve, but if we set\nthe passage in it\u2019s context we will discover that this may have\nbeen far more than Jesus praying about the calling of the twelve.</strong></p><p><strong>As\n21 century Christians we are inclined to read the bible, especially\nthe gospel in a dislocated way, which can make it more difficult to\nplace stories in their context. This is not our fault. Our bibles\nhave chapter numbers, verse numbers and many modern versions have\nheadings that tell us what the proceeding verses are about. All these\nthings are helpful and allow us to navigate ourselves around the\nbible. However, if we were to remove the chapter and verse numbers,\nand remove the introductory heading, I think this and many other\npassage would read very differently.</strong></p><p><strong>The\ncontext of the passage:-</strong></p><p><strong>Luke\n6:12 begins with the words \u2018One day soon after,\u2019 NLT. The NIV\nreads \u2018One of those days.\u2019 These words tie Jesus going up the\nmountain to pray, with events that had taken place before he spent\nthe night in prayer. So there was something going on in the life of\nJesus that motivated Him to withdraw to a mountain and spend the\nnight in prayer. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nLuke 5:17-6:11 there are five stories, in all which, there is a\ncommon theme i.e. Jesus was attacked, undermined and questioned.</strong></p><p><strong>a.\nHe was accused of blasphemy,   we are told in Luke 5:21 \u2018But the\nPharisees and teachers of religious law said to themselves. \u2018Who\ndoes he think he is?  This is blasphemy. Only God can forgive sins.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong><strong><br/>\nJohn\nMacArthur says:-</strong></strong><strong>\n\u2018Blasphemy was the most heinous crime in Jewish thought, since it\nwas a direct affront to the person of God.

A more serious form of blasphemy was\nto slander, speak evil of, or curse God Himself (</strong><a href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Lev.%2024.10%E2%80%9316\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Lev.\n24:10\u201316</strong></a><strong>;\ncf. </strong><a href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Exod.%2020.7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Ex.\n20:7</strong></a><strong>).\nBut the ultimate form of blasphemy was to assume the rights and\nprerogatives of God; to usurp the role of God and act as if one were\nGod.

    "html": "<p><strong>There\nare a number of lessons this can teach us.</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nThis story is about Jesus embracing his humanity. Luke tells us that\nhe prayed to God all night. As a man in the midst of the storm, Jesus\nprobably felt the need to bring the pain of his heart to God. Jesus\nwas not some kind of superhuman who was impervious to criticism,\nridicule or threat. He was not a dispassionate \u2018Tin man,\u2019 who\ncould remain unmoved or untouched by the mistreatment of others. So\nas a man, in all his human vulnerability he prayed to God and in\nhumility and submission he yielded himself to the purposes of God,\ndespite great opposition.</strong></p><p><strong>2.\nJesus made time and space to deal with his circumstances before God.\nThis is the only occasion in the bible were we read of an individual\nspending the whole night in prayer. Jesus was very intentional in how\nhe responded to the growing opposition and criticism he was facing. I\nlove the fact that Jesus allowed his mistreatment by others to\nmatter, he didn\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t matter, or it wasn\u2019t an\nissue that he could ignore. Rather, it seems that the only way he\nchose to respond to the increasing opposition was through a prolonged\nperiod of prayer.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nLuke speaks about Jesus praying \u2018all night\u2019 he uses the word\ndianyktereuo. This is the only time we find this word in the bible.\nOutside the bible it was used in the world of medicine to describe a\nwhole nights vigil.</strong><strong>\nIt also had a military rather than religious associations.  I think\nthis gives us some insight as to how Jesus was praying, was this a\nPre-Gethsemane experience? Could it be that on that night as he\nwrestled in prayer He found the resolve and courage to go forward in\nhis call and ministry?</strong></p><p><strong>It\nwas in the context of Jesus dealing spiritually with the threatening\nissues of his life that he got a clearer understanding about the way\nforward.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nwill be times in all our live when the pressure of life will stop us\nfrom moving forward in the direction God may be calling us to, we may\nfeel overwhelmed or paralysed with fear, we can allow the\ndifficulties of the present to prevent us from stepping into the\nfuture.</strong></p><p><strong>3.\nThis night of prayer may have been more about receiving the courage\nto lead, than about the wisdom to decide.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus called these disciples and chose them to be Apostles, we must\nremember that he had known them for a while. He had been in their\nhomes, he had been at their places of work, their place of worship,\nhe had partied with them, he had journeyed with them. But now it was\ntime for change, a time to develop them from disciples to Apostles. </strong></p><p><strong>Before\nwe go on, I think there is a lesson in this for us. As we deal with\nthe conflicts and intimidations of life in a spiritual way, this will\nproduce in us healing courage so we will be more equipped to lead and\ninfluence others for their good. We can allow unresolved issues of\nrejection, intimidation and misunderstanding to cause us to withdraw\ninto cosy self protection from which we have no ability to be a\npositive influence or encouragement on/to others.  </strong></p><p><strong>We\nhave become so used to reading about Jesus and the Apostles that we\nhave missed how radical Jesus is being here. Luke tells us at\n\u2018daybreak\u2019 he called together his disciples. I love that Luke\nrefers to \u2018daybreak\u2019  it is as if he was saying, \u2018this is a new\nday, Jesus has just spent the night wrestling in prayer and things\nare never going to be the same.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus called these disciples to become Apostles, he was making a very\nstrong statement about who he was and how he saw his future. He was\nsaying \u2018I am much more than a Rabbi.\u2019  The calling of the\napostles was declaration of intent, it was refusal to be intimidated,\nit was an expression of determination and certainty, it was the\ndecree of a king.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword for Apostles comes from Apostolos which refers to someone who\nwas officially commissioned to a position or task, such as an envoy.</strong><strong>\nCargo ships were sometimes called </strong><em><strong>apostolic</strong></em><strong>,\nbecause they were dispatched with a specific shipment for a specific\ndestination. In secular Greek, Apostolos was used of an admiral of a\nfleet sent out by the King on special assignment. In the ancient\nworld, an Apostle was the personal representative of the King,\nfunctioning as an ambassador with the King\u2019s authority and provided\nwith credentials to prove he was the King's envoy.</strong></p><p><strong>You\ncould say in Jesus\u2019 world, Rabbi's had disciples, Kings had\napostles. So when Jesus called them apostles, it would have been very\nunexpected, it would have began to change their understanding of\nJesus. Their lives had now taken on a regal significance, they were\nnow designated as emissaries of a King.  </strong></p><p><strong>4.\nGod purposes and goals for you life is rooted in discipleship.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nare told,\u2019At daybreak He called together his disciples and chose\ntwelve of them to be his Apostles.\u2019 The disciples became apostles.\nFor these disciples, \u2018Apostles\u2019  was  what God wanted them to\nbecome, and what God wanted them to do. Their call to be \u2018Apostles\nneeded to be rooted in discipleship. It is the same for us, we will\nnot be the people God wants us to be, or do the things God wants us\nto do, without a life of discipleship.</strong></p><p><strong>It\nis very interesting that we would refer to ourselves as Christians\nbefore we would see ourselves as disciples. The name Christian, is\nonly found 3 times in the bible, (Acts 11:25-26, </strong><strong>Acts\n26:28, 1 Peter 4:16). What\u2019s interesting about all three of these\noccurrences is that the word \u201cChristian\u201d as a title or identifier\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be self-applied. Rather, it is non-Christians,\nunbelievers, people who do not follow Jesus, who are using the term\nto describe or identify Jesus\u2019 disciples or followers.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword disciple is found 261 times in the Gospels and Acts, 297 times\nin the New Testament. When it come to understanding our part, or role\nin our spiritual journey and maturity, we need to think and behave\nlike disciples. Dallas Williard said \u2018His disciples were with him\nlearning to be like him.\u2019 This truly captures the essence of\ndiscipleship. Transformation because of authentic fellowship with\nJesus.</strong></p><p><strong>have\nsaid nothing about the \u2018twelve\u2019 that Jesus called to be his\napostles. But I wonder what our lives would be like if our names were\nin that list. Jesus will never call us to be capital A \u2018Apostles\u2019\nlike these disciples, but we can be sure of three things. </strong></p><p><strong>1.Jesus\nwill call you to something. You will never be a spectator or a\npassenger, every disciple has the call of God upon their lives. </strong></p><p><strong>2.\nThe call of God grows from a life of discipleship, being with him,\nbeing like him.</strong></p><p><strong>3.\nDiscipleship equips us for the will of God. </strong><strong>We\nwill never be called to be apostles like these first disciples. But\neverything we have been called to has apostolic significance because\nwe are emissaries of THE GREAT KING.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that because Jesus had the courage to deal with his own\npain he was able turn disciples into apostles.  </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Joshua 1 1:10-14:15.</p>",

      "I wonder how we as a Christian community, understand the gospel? What is the gospel? Let me ask, is it appropriate to share the message of the gospel without a gospel lifestyle? This leads to an other question. What is a gospel lifestyle? Or in what ways is our Christian faith counter-cultural to the world around us? If we had a \u2018heart grasp\u2019 of what Jesus as taught in Luke 6, we could only conclude that his words were unconventional, counter-intuitive, counter-cultural, and radical."

As you may know a Roman\nCenturion was someone who was in charge of 100 plus  men. We know a\nnumber of facts from history about the life of a Centurion in Israel\nat this time.</strong></p><p><strong>During\nthe New Testament era, a Roman centurion was a professional military\nofficer commanding a platoon of troops called a \u201ccentury.\u201d This\ncould be anywhere from nearly one hundred to several hundred men.\nEach Roman legion was composed of 5,000-6,000 men, divided into\nmultiple cohorts, each cohort composed of multiple centuries. As a\nresult, a legion could contain as many as sixty centurions. Their\nimportance was based on seniority, with the senior centurion in a\nlegion being in a position of great prestige. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nrank of centurion was the highest that an ordinary soldier could\nreach. Those who filled this office were career soldiers who had to\nbe good leaders. 15 years service was required before a solider could\nbecome a centurion. The discipline and efficiency of the Roman\nmilitary machine depended on them. According to one source,\ncenturions \u201cwere often the most experienced and best-informed men\nin the army.\u201d </strong></p><p><strong>This\nparticular centurion could not have been part of the Roman army,\nhowever, since there were no Roman forces in Galilee at the time;\ninstead, he probably belonged to the royal troops of Herod Antipas.\nRulers appointed by Rome and were expected to maintain an army and to\nprovide Rome with military support when necessary.</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>The\naverage lifespan of a Roman Centurion is not well-documented.\nHowever, it is believed that it was around 25-30 years. This is due\nto the harsh conditions of military life, as well as the high\nmortality rate in battle. The ancient historian Polybius offers a\nlist of qualifications looked for in centurions. They must be not so\nmuch \"seekers after danger as men who can command, steady in\naction, and reliable; they ought not to be over anxious to rush into\nthe fight; but when hard pressed they must be ready to hold their\nground and die at their posts.</strong><strong>\n This centurion, would have been a highly paid military man. An\naverage soldier was paid 75 denari; a centurion 3,750-7,500 denari.  </strong></p><p><strong>T</strong><strong>o\nthe Jew, the centurion had three things against him: he was bitterly\nhated because he was non-Jewish, a Gentile; he was of the nation that\nhad conquered Palestine, and he was of the armed and occupying force.\n</strong></p><p><strong>Interestingly,\nevery time a centurion is mentioned in the New Testament it is with\nhonour</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>So\nto be a centurion was a tough, dangerous job, which would require a\n\u2018\u2019kill or be killed\u2019 attitude. And yet the centurion we meet in\nour story did not really fit the status-quo, he did not comply with\nconventional perceptions and understandings of what a centurion\nshould be.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nworld needs people like this centurion, who are atypical because they\nhave a dynamic relationship with God. We need to become people who do\nnot fit into nice, neat tidy boxes. People who are positively\ndistinctive, not odd, strange or awkward, but people who threaten the\nessence of a godless culture through love and grace. This front line\nsolider had the courage to be different, he had the courage not to be\n\u2018pigeon holed.\u2019 I wonder if we have inadvertently turned the\nchurch into a \u2018sausage factory\u2019 where we mass produce a\n\u2019Christian experience,\u2019 that allows us to feel content with the\nbland of the status-quo.     </strong></p><p><strong>Father\n,may I be  positively distinctive</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Joshua 21:13-23:16</p>",

He had no rights. In\nfact, a master could abuse him and even kill him if he chose to do\nso. A Roman writer on estate management recommended the farmer to\nexamine his implements every year and to throw out those which were\nold and broken, and to do the same with his own slaves. Normally when\na slave was past his ability to work, he was thrown out to die.  They\nwere bought and sold at slave markets across the ancient world, and\nwere paraded by their owners as a sign of wealth: the more enslaved\npeople a person owned, it was thought, the greater their stature and\nwealth. They were considered the property of their masters, enslaved\nRomans were often subjected to vile treatment, including physical and\nsexual abuse. </strong></p><p><strong>This\ncenturion esteemed, respected, and had a high regard for this slave.\nHe didn\u2019t look down on him, or belittle him, or see him as less\nthan. The respect we show or don\u2019t show to others says more about\nus than it does about them. Does respect need to be earned? Do others\nneed to deserve our respect? Respect cannot be demanded, nor should\nbe tied to someone\u2019s status or position in life.

So\nthey earnestly begged Jesus to help the man. \u201cIf anyone deserves\nyour help, he does,\u201d they said, \u201cfor he loves the Jewish people\nand even built a synagogue for us.\u2019 I think these verses are\namazing. Here we have a pagan solider enlisted in the Roman army. He\nis respected by the Jewish religious leaders and he built a\nsynagogue. The incredible thing is not that he was prepared to pay\nfor the building of the synagogue, but that the Jewish leaders let\nhim build it in the first place. In these days the predominate\nworld-view of Judaism was aggressively anti-gentile. The Gentiles\nwere despised and hated by the Jews, and some how this member of an\noccupying enemy force was able to remove all the barriers between\nhimself and his antagonists so he could show love. Some people think\nthat this centurion may have been a convert to Judaism, but this is\nunlikely as Jewish men were not allowed to enlist into the Roman\narmy.  Can you grasp how counter-cultural this man was? He did not\nallow the stereotypical norms or expectations of society to dictate\nhis actions. He loved his enemy, he did good to those who hated him.\nThis was authentic faith, living out a set of beliefs that will\nenable you to touch the very heart of community.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me to be different but not odd. </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Joshua 24 Judges 1-2</p>",

And he told a Canaanite women that her faith was\ngreat, see Matthew 15:28.but this the only time Jesus was amazed by\nsomeone\u2019s faith. This man\u2019s faith was not set of dogmas or\ntheological tenets that he subscribed to. It was much more than a\nsure confidence in the authority and power of Jesus. Rather it was a\nconfident belief in the authority and power of Jesus that directed\nand shaped how he lived and how he treated others. <br/>\n</strong></p><p><strong>I\ndo not think it is a coincidence that the person whose faith amazed\nJesus was a centurion, because to live a life of faith requires great\ncourage in the face of threatening circumstances, just like this\ncenturion.

The way we serve God has more to do with\ncharacter, than gift or ability so Jesus addresses the whole issue of\ncharacter at this time because he knows that for them to fulfil the\nrole of Apostles, they would need much more than divine ability, they\nwould require godly characters. A further emphasis of the sermon is\nthe protection and the development of relationships. Being salt and\nlight, and the proper fulfilment of the law are about healthy\nrelationships. In the 'Lord's Prayer' the reference is to forgiving\nothers.</strong></p><p><strong>These\ntwo emphases, character and relationships, can be summed up in one\nword, righteousness. The word righteousness is not only a descriptive\nword that describes the moral conduct of someone, but it is also a\nrelational word, describing how we relate to others. Jesus said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"For\nI tell you unless your righteousness surpasses the righteousness of\nthe Pharisees and teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter\nthe kingdom of heaven.\" 5:20</strong></span><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhat does it mean to be righteous?</strong></p><p><strong>1.\n</strong><u><strong>Righteousness\nis being blessed.</strong></u></p><p><strong>When\nwe think of being blessed, we usually suffer from a totally wrong\nunderstanding. \"In ancient Greek times, makarios, blessed\nreferred to the gods. The blessed ones were the gods. They had\nachieved a state of happiness and contentment in life that was beyond\nall cares, labours, and even death. The blessed ones were beings who\nlived way up there in some other world. To be blessed, you had to be\na god. That word took on a second meaning. It referred to the \"dead\".\nThe blessed ones were humans, who, through death, had reached the\nother world of the gods. They were now beyond the cares of earthly\nlife. To be blessed, you had to be dead. Finally, in Greek usage, the\nword came to refer to the elite, the upper crust of society, the\nwealthy people. It referred to people whose riches and power put them\nabove the normal cares and worries of the lesser folk the peons, who\nconstantly struggle and worry and labour in life. To be blessed, you\nhad to be very rich and powerful. When this word, makarios was used\nin the Greek translation of the Old Testament, it took on an another\nmeaning. It referred to the results of right living or righteousness.\nIf you lived right, you were blessed. Being blessed meant you\nreceived earthly, material things: a good wife, many children,\nabundant crops, riches, honour, wisdom, beauty, good health, etc. </strong></p><p><strong>A\nblessed person had more things and better things than an ordinary\nperson. To be blessed, you had to have big and beautiful things. In\nall of these meanings, the \"blessed\" ones existed on a\nhigher plane than the rest of the people. They were \u2018gods.\u2019 They\nwere humans who had gone to that other world of the gods. They were\nthe wealthy, upper crust. They were those with many possessions.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Jesus\nuses this word in a totally different way. It is not the elite who\nare blessed. It is not the rich and powerful who are blessed. It is\nnot the high and mighty who are blessed. It is not the people living\nin huge mansions or expensive penthouses who are blessed. Rather,\nJesus pronounces God's blessings on the lowly: the poor, the hungry,\nthe crying, and the hated. Throughout the history of this word, it\nhad always been the other people who were considered blessed: the\nrich, the filled up, the laughing. Jesus turns it all upside-down.\nThe elite in God's kingdom, the blessed ones in God's kingdom, are\nthose who are at the bottom of the heap of humanity.\" Brian P.\nStoffregen</strong></p><p><strong>Many\npeople understand the word Blessed to mean the same as being happy,\nbut this is not what it means, the best way to understand the word\nblessed is to see it from God's perspective. So blessed could be\ntranslated, \"Those who have God's approval.\" So the\nblessing spoken of here, is referring to those who have a character\nthat God approves of. An indication as to how blessed we are is seen\nin the kind of character we have. Notice when Jesus speaks of being\nblessed he never mentions material possessions, or worldly\nachievements.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay I be blessed with a godly character </strong><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan Judges  6-7</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Judges 3-5 D ay</p>",

If\nyou look carefully, you will notice that the first and last beatitude\nends with the same promise. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"Blessed\nare the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven</strong></span><strong>\"\nand </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"Blessed\nare those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is\nthe kingdom of heaven.</strong></span><strong>\"\nVerse 11 is not considered as one of the beatitudes because it is\nworded differently, it is viewed more of an explanation of verse 10.\nThe promise given in the first and last beatitude is given in the\npresent tense, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"for\ntheirs is the kingdom of heaven.\"</strong></span><strong>\nWhile the promises given in the second through to the seventh are in\nthe future tense, \"They will.</strong></p><p><strong>\"\n\"Now\nwhat is the meaning of this pattern? I think there are at least two\nimplications. First, by sandwiching six promises in between two\nassurances that such people have the kingdom of heaven, I think Jesus\nmeans to tell us that these six promises are blessings of the\nkingdom. In other words, these six things are what you can count on\nwhen you are a part of God's kingdom. This is what the kingdom\nbrings: comfort, earth ownership, satisfied righteousness, mercy, a\nvision of God, and the awesome title, son of God. You don't have to\npick and choose among these promises. They all belong to the kingdom.\nSecondly, I see in the fact that Jesus begins with the assurance,\n\"Theirs is the kingdom of heaven,\" and ends with the\nassurance, \"Theirs is the kingdom of heaven\" with six\npromises sandwiched in between. I think this is Jesus' way of saying\nthat in some sense the kingdom of heaven is present with the\ndisciples now (Theirs is the kingdom of heaven) but that the full\nblessings of the kingdom will have to wait for the age to come (They\nshall inherit the earth).\" John Piper.\nhttps://www.desiringgod.org/messages/the-beatitudes-and-the-gospel-of-the-kingdom#:~:text=The%20Blessings%20of%20the%20Kingdom,a%20part%20of%20God's%20kingdom.\nAccessed 26/06/2025</strong></p><p><strong>3.\nEvery beatitude is in striking contrast to the character and conduct\nof the Scribes and Pharisees. When you look at the attitudes\nportrayed by the scribes and the Pharisees, it was completely\nopposite to that described by Jesus in the beatitudes. Twice in the\nsermon Jesus warns his disciples \"do not be like them\"\nMatthew 6:5,8. Notice carefully what Jesus says here, He did not say,\n\"Do not do what they do,\" but \"do not be like them.\"\nHe was referring to their characters.</strong></p><p><u><strong>The\nPharisees were proud, not poor in spirit.</strong></u></p><p><strong>As\nfar as I'm aware, there is only one other place in first century\nJewish literature where the phrase 'poor in spirit' occurs and that\nis in the Dead Sea Scrolls. \"Among the poor in spirit [there is\npower] over the hard of heart.\" These two separate phrases\ndeclare opposites, which are being contrasted. What the phrase 'poor\nin spirit' seems to mean, therefore, is the antithesis of 'hard of\nheart' The poor in spirit are those who are not self-assertive,\nself-reliant, self-confident, self-centred, or self-sufficient.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nare two Greek words for poor. PENES describe the person who does not\nhave a lot; they live from day to day, someone like a day labourer,\nwho was paid a daily wage. The second word is the word PTOCHOS means\nto crouch like a beggar, this describes the person who has nothing,\nwho is completely destitute, and this is the word Jesus uses. Being\npoor in spirit is a strong realisation of our desperate need of God,\nnot just for salvation, but for every thing in life.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nPharisees were self satisfied and self-content, because of their\nself-righteousness they had nothing to mourn over. When Jesus speaks\nof mourning he uses a very strong word. It was the word used to\ndescribe the external evidences of an internal grief. In other words,\nJesus is talking about people being real. Often in Christian circles\nthere is a tendency to bury how we really feel in order to protect\nourselves from further pain or rejection. But Jesus is saying that\nmourning is part of a healthy Christian experience.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe bury stuff we die spiritually, many people believe that if they\nignore a problem, or bury a pain it will go away. Living in the\nkingdom of God is a call to reality. The focus of the Pharisees was\nalways to keep up the appearance of have everything under control, to\nlook cool, but never dealing with reality. Those who mourn will find\ncomfort; the comfort of God brings healing and hope.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nis a very important principle for us to learn, there is great\ntemptation for us to look cool, and in the process bury wounds and\nhurts that can only be healed when they are brought out in the open.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nPharisees were hard, quick to condemn others. They were not gentle or\nmeek. The biblical word \"meek\" comes from the Greek word\npraos, which means \"mild, humble, or gentle.\" Classical\nGreek uses it in many ways. Meekness refers to describe a soothing\nmedicine. Meekness refers to a gentle breeze. Meekness refers to a\ncolt that is broken and useful. Meekness refers to person who treats\nothers with respect, dignity, politeness and courtesy. In one of\nPlato's works, a child asked a physician to be \"gentle\"\nwith him. The word for meekness was used in much extra-biblical\nliterature to refer to a horse that had been trained. Therefore the\nidea is \"power under control.\"A horse that is trained is\nuseful and safe. However one that cannot be controlled is useless and\ndangerous. It was used to describe a medicine that can bring healing.\n</strong></p><p><strong>However\na horse that cannot be controlled can </strong><strong>kill.\nA wind that blows with controlled speeds is useful to pump water and\nprovide energy. One without control is destructive. A person who can\ncontrol his words is encouraging and pleasant. A person who is not\nmeek and gentle is out of control. Living in the kingdom of God is\nbowing to the control of another..</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n</strong></span></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"The\nmeek will inherit the earth.\"</strong></span><strong>\nThere is a simple principle here; God will not give those who are out\nof control any inheritance. God gives those who are gentle, positions\nof authority.</strong></p><p><strong>But\nhow is such meekness produced in a person? This gentleness is the\nresult of the healing comfort of God. In the beatitude before this\none we are told that those who mourn shall be comforted. The word for\ncomfort means to draw along beside someone in order to encourage and\nexhort him or her in times of sorrow. Often people end up hard and\nbitter as a result of the sorrows of life. This hardness is caused by\nthe refusal to receive the comfort of God.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nis their any area of my life that is not touched by meekness, where I\nam out of control?</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Judges 8-9</p>"

There should be an overwhelming desire\nfor righteousness. We need to cultivate a love for righteousness. The\nthirst and hunger mentioned here is an unquenchable one, the result\nof prolonged deprivation. The Puritan Thomas Watson wrote, \"He\nwho has most need of righteousness is he that least wants it.\"\nWhy is it important that we develop and encourage such a hunger in\nour own hearts and in the hearts of others? Righteousness brings hope\nand security to a person. Why? For righteousness brings satisfaction.\nThe Greek word for filled is chortazo, which was often used to\ndescribe the feeding of animals until they were so full they could\neat no more. When we lack contentment and satisfaction we will turn\nto sin in order to find fulfilment. If a person has a strong desire\nand appetite for righteousness, how will that effect how he treats\nothers? Fulfilment in this life can only be experienced as we\nincrease in righteousness.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe were to divide the beatitudes into two groups of four, the first\nfour speak of those who feel their need of righteousness, while the\nsecond four is speaking about those who display righteousness.

What is mercy? The Greek\nword here was originally used to describe the emotion aroused by\ncontact with an undeserved affliction that comes on someone else. We\nmight use the words \"sympathy,\" \"pity\" or\n\"compassion.\" Mercy may involve such acts as pardon,\nforgiveness, or the mitigation of penalties. Mercy is experienced and\nexercised by a person who has another person in his power, or under\nhis authority, or from whom no kindness can be claimed. Mercy is an\nessential requirement for healthy relationships. Having a heart full\nof mercy will help a person respond properly to the pain that comes\nthrough difficult relationships, and enables a person to reach out to\nthose who are less fortunate.</strong></p><p><strong>A\nperson, who is incapable of showing mercy, is dehumanised, for mercy\nis one of the noblest expressions of what it means to be human and\nmade in the likeness of God. The person who is poor in spirit,\nmourning over sin, meek submissive to God in all things, and\nhungering and thirsting after righteousness is going to be merciful.\nIf a person is not merciful, then the other qualities are also\nlacking. </strong></p><p><strong>Father,\nmay my life display mercy to other</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Judges 10-13</p>"

For a\nPharisee peace meant having the ability to control things or people,\nso their expectations and needs would be met. Jesus said, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"Blessed\nare the peacemakers for they will be called the sons of God.\"</strong></span><strong>\nIt is important to notice that Jesus is not talking about\npeacekeepers, but peacemakers.</strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhat is a peacemaker?</strong></p><p><strong>To\nhelp us answer this question, it would be helpful to say what a\npeacemaker is not. A peacemaker is not someone who tries to keep the\npeace at all costs; they are not someone who buries issues, hoping\nthat they will go away, they would never sweep things under the\ncarpet. In fact a peacemaker may be viewed as a troublemaker, why?\nBecause they will insist that an issue will be brought out in the\nopen, so it can be dealt with properly.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nultimate expression of peacemaking is Jesus' death on the cross. \"For\nGod was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through\nhim to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or\nthings in heaven, by making </strong><u><strong>peace</strong></u><strong>\nthrough his blood, shed on the cross.\" Colossians 1:19-20. In\nother words, peacemaking is a very demanding and painful. This is not\na licence for us to go around and always being in people's face or on\ntheir cases. To be a peacemaker you must also be poor in spirit,\nmournful over your own failure, gentle, etc. If we are not pure in\nheart, then we are in need of the help of a peacemaker for a lack of\npeace within ourselves, and with others, is an indication that we are\nnot pure in heart.</strong></p><p><strong>For\nsome people like myself, this is the most scary and demanding\nbeatitude, because of our dislike of confrontation. But if we are\ngoing to be known as sons of God, then we must be willing to be\ninvolved in peacemaking, or the \"ministry of reconciliation,\"\nto use Paul's phrase.</strong></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"Blessed\nare those who are persecuted for righteousness: for theirs is the\nkingdom of heaven.\"</strong></span></p><p><strong>The\nPharisees were not persecuted for righteousness, rather they\npersecuted the righteous.</strong></p><p><strong>Some\nsee the last two beatitudes as two separate beatitudes, while others\nsee them as one. I don't think it matters. Reading this beatitude is\not very comforting. Twice Jesus says that a person who is persecuted\nis blessed. So how is persecution a blessing? Before we answer that,\nwe need to point out that often people have misused these verses,\nthose they are in your face, ramming the gospel down your throat.\nWhen they are persecuted, they get puffed up with pride, wrongly\nbelieving that they are being persecuted for righteousness.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nrighteousness that Jesus is referring to here is the result of \ncombined qualities of all the beatitudes expressed through life. It\nis interesting to note that this beatitude comes after Jesus speaking\nabout peacemaking. Peacemakers will attract persecution because of\nwhat they stand for.</strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhat is Persecution, and how is it a blessing?</strong></p><p><strong>Persecution,\nthe word Jesus uses here is dioko, which literally means to be\nchased, it was used in the LXX to describe being chased by hostile\nsoldiers</strong></p><p><strong>To\ninsult, the word means to reproach or complain about, to cast in\none's teeth.</strong></p><p><strong>To\nfalsely accuse, to deceive by lies, to speak all kinds of evil\nagainst. This is the complete opposite of the righteous character of\nthose who display the attributes of the beatitudes. But how is this\nkind of hassle to be seen as a blessing?</strong></p><p><strong>There\nare three reasons that Jesus gives which explain why this persecution\ncan be perceived as a blessing.</strong></p><p><strong>First\nof all, it is suffering for His sake. It is a distinct privilege to\nsuffer for the sake of Christ.</strong></p><p><strong>Secondly,\nsuffering in the present gives promise of future rewards: \"Rejoice,\nand be glad, for your reward in heaven is great.\"</strong></p><p><strong>Thirdly,\nwe can rejoice because persecution for Christ's sake places us in the\ncompany of the prophets of old, who, for their testimony, were\npersecuted as well.</strong></p><p><strong>What\ncan we learn from these blessings?</strong></p><p><strong>Suffering\nfor Christ is the deepest kind of fellowship we can have with Christ.\nWhen we suffer because of our righteousness, we are sharing in his\nsufferings. To have fellowship in someone's suffering, to suffer\nalong with them, is real intimacy.</strong></p><p><strong>Suffering\nreminds us that we haven't got home yet. Our reward is in heaven.\nWhen people believe that all their needs can be met in this world,\nthen they will not be able to cope with persecution. But for\nbeatitude people, their hearts are set on heaven.</strong></p><p><strong>Suffering\nfor righteousness, reminds us that this is the way it has always been\nfor those who live close to God, like the prophets. We should not be\nsurprised if righteous living causes an offence to an evil world.</strong></p><p><strong>The\ntype of person that the beatitudes describe is the most concise and\naccurate description we have of a disciple. The goal of discipleship\nis seen in the beatitudes.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay I have then courage to be a peacemaker</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Judges 17:1-20:11</p>",

Three things had happen to Jesus that\nmay have caused him to be discouraged.</strong></p><p><strong>John\nwas in prison and because of his circumstances he began to doubt if\nhe had made a mistake about Jesus, was He really the promised\nMessiah? The generation in which Jesus lived was totally\ninconsistent. They condemned John for fasting, and condemned Jesus\nfor feasting. It was a generation that could never be satisfied. </strong></p><p><strong>After\nmonths of ministry in the cities of Korazin, Berthsaida and\nCapernaum, Jesus who must have been weary had no choice than to\ndenounce them for their unreasonable and determined rejection. This\nwas not easy for Jesus, he loved these people, he had made his home\nwith them. These denouncements most have taken their toll on him. So\nin order to keep his perspective, and to encourage him to reach out\nin the future, he turns to his Father in prayer</strong></p><p><strong>What\ncan we learn from this prayer?</strong></p><p><strong>When\nyou consider the prayer life of Jesus as it is recorded in the four\nGospels there are two interesting factors. We are only told the\ncontents of Jesus' prayers in the second half of his ministry. We\nhave instances of Jesus praying in the first half of his ministry,\nbut we are never told what he said. The reason for this may be that\nthe Gospels writers are trying to teach us 'How we approach God is\nmore important than what we say.'</strong></p><p><strong>The\nprayers that we do have recorded of Jesus, most of them are said in\ntimes of crisis, especially around his passion. Jesus did not allow\nthe pain of life to prevent him from having an intimate relationship\nwith his Father. Often in times of crisis our prayer life becomes\nmore an expression of panic rather than fellowship. How we pray in\ntimes of difficulty reveal what we really think of God.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus'\nrelationship with his Father helped him cope with the stress of\nministry.</strong></p><p><strong>I\ndon't know if you have ever felt like a failure, sometimes feelings\nof failure are appropriate, you have an exam, or a driving tests, and\nyou know that you have done nothing to prepare for it, and you fail,\nyour not surprised. But what happens, when like Jesus, you give\nyourself one hundred percent, hoping that people would turn to God\nand repent, and they don't. The feelings of failure would be far\nworse. It would have been very easy for Jesus to give up, and think,\n\"what's the point\"? To prevent discouragement from eating\nhim up, he turned to his Father.</strong></p><p><strong>To\ncall God, Father was a new concept to the Jews. In the Old Testament\nGod is referred to as father, but only sparingly, only twenty-one\ntimes. And when he is referred to father it is never as 'father to an\nindividual, but as father to the nation of Israel. However, in the\ngospels God is referred to as father one hundred and seventy times.\nThis was the title Jesus uses most for God. It was because Jesus felt\nso secure in his relationship with his Father that he was able to\ngive the wonderful invitation </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"Come\nunto me all who are weary.\"</strong></span></p><p><strong>Jesus\nprayer was an expression of total submission. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nread \"At that time Jesus said, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"I\npraise you Father.\"</strong></span><strong>\nWhen we think of praise, most of us think in terms of our emotions,\nwe think that to praise God is to feel emotionally happy with\nwhatever God brings into our life. This understanding is a perversion\nas the Greek word used here for praise is exomologeo. It means to\nacknowledge or agree fully: confess, profess, and promise. To praise\nGod is to submit to him, to acknowledge that he God, and what he does\nis always right.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nkind of submission is only possible, when we are experiencing God as\nour Father, and we are living like his Sons. Surrendering our lives\nto God is not a one off experience, it is something that is ongoing,\nand is an essential requirement if we are going to cope with the\ndemands of life and ministry. This kind of submission will produce a\nheart of gratitude, so we yield our lives to our Fa</strong><strong>ther\nas an expression of thanks and gratitude</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nprayer expressed the belief that his Father was sovereign.

God resists the proud,\nand hides truth from them, but reveals truth to children. The word\nfor children nepios literally means, \"not speaking,\" so it\nrefers to infants prior to their learning to speak. There is a very\nimportant principle here, the ways of kingdom are only learned,\nunderstood and applied properly in the context of a dependant\nrelationship and ongoing communication with the father. The ways of\nthe kingdom, and how God works in his world are not learned like a\nmathematical formula, but it is only as we open our hearts to God and\ndepend on him, that we will be able to understand his ways. The truth\nthat it was his Fathers pleasure to reveal these things...to little\nchildren\" helped Jesus understand the rejection of the people in\nthe three cities.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nemphasises the importance of being a Son.</strong><u><strong>\n</strong></u></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"All\nthings have been committed to me by my Father.

Many people feel that the burden Jesus was speaking\nof when he said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'Come\nto me, all you who are weary and burdened',</strong></span><strong>\nwas the burden of the law that the Pharisees had laid upon the\npeople. The law was originally intended as the essentials necessary\nfor the journey of faith by God's people. Unfortunately, over the\nyears the children of Israel added to the list, adding much more than\nwas necessary for the trip. For every \"thou shalt\" or \"thou\nshalt not\" they added many more commandments, so that the\nbackpack grew in size to overpower those who had to carry it. By the\ntime Jesus came along, it was too heavy for the journey. So Jesus\nwanted to remove the burden of the law from people.</strong></p><p><strong>Although\nthis is a legitimate application of what Jesus is saying, I don't\nthink this was his primary thought. In the context of Matthew 11\nJesus is not directly addressing the issue of legalism.</strong></p><p><strong>A\nsecond thing we need to understand is what Jesus meant by yoke. The\nyoke mentioned shouldn't be thought of as a wooden object, which was\nused to join two animals together, so that they might pull a plough\nor some other such agricultural device. Rather it was a wooden yoke\nplaced over the shoulders of a single human being which was used to\nbalance the weight being carried on two extremes, thus enabling the\nload to be laid upon the entire frame of the person</strong></p><p><strong>A\nthird factor is how the Old Testament uses the symbol of the yoke.</strong></p><p><strong>\"This\nis what the Lord said to me; 'Make a yoke out of straps and crossbars\nand put it on your neck. Then send word to the kings of Edon, Moab,\nAmmon, Tyre and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem\nto Zedekiah King of Judah. Give them this message for their masters\nand say. This is what the Lord almighty the God of Israel says. Tell\nthis to your masters: with my great power I made the earth and its\npeople and the animals that are on it, and I give it to anyone I\nplease. Now I will hand all your countries over to my servant\nNebuchadnezzar King of Babylon; I will even make the wild animals\nsubject to him. All the nations will serve him and his son and his\ngrandson until the time for his land comes; then many nations and\ngreat kings will subjugate him. If, however, any nation will not\nserve Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon or bow its neck under his yoke,\nI will punish that nation with the sword, famine and plague declares\nthe Lord, until I destroy it by his hand. So do not listen to your\nprophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums or\nyour sorcerers who tell you. 'You will not serve the King of\nBabylon,' They prophesy lies to you that will only serve to remove\nyou far from your lands; I will banish you and you will perish. But\nif any nation will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon\nand serve him I will, I will let that nation remain in its own land,\ntill it, and to live there declares the Lord. I gave the same message\nto Zedekiah King of Judah. Bow your neck under the yoke of the king\nof Babylon; serve him and his people and you will live.\"\nJeremiah 27:1-12.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nGod was judging the nations he placed a yoke on them as a form of\npunishment, this yoke implies the death of a way of life and the loss\nof a sense of identity. When Jesus offered people his yoke, he was\npromising them more than a release from they heavy burdens, he was\npromising a new way of life and a new identity. So the yoke spoke\nabout a persons identity and value system. The yoke is whatever\ncontrols and masters our lives.</strong></p><p><strong>With\nthese facts in mind, we can answer two important questions. What was\nChrist\u2019s yoke? And how did he carry it? </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me be controlled and mastered by your yoke</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Ruth 2:14-4:12 1Samuel 1</p>",

The former became the head\nof the Palestinian part of the Movement after the crucifixion.

After recording Jesus' confrontation\nwith the Pharisees, Mark writes; \"Then </strong>\n\n<strong>Jesus'\nmother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in\nto call him. A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him 'Your\nmother and brothers are outside looking for you.' 'Who are my mother\nand brothers?' He asked.

Whoever does\nGod's will is my brother and sister and mother.\" Mark 3:31-35</strong></p><p><strong>What\nMark says here is very interesting and can teach us many lessons.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nis not only facing opposition from the religious authorities, but he\nis also facing pressure from his family.

They\nthought that Jesus had lost his way, and they may have felt\nembarrassed by him. Nazareth was about 30 miles from Capernaum so why\ndid Jesus' family make such a long trip to seek Him out? Because they\nwanted to control him. The word used for 'Take charge of' is the\nGreek word Krateo. This is a very strong word, which means to seize\nor arrest. We are not told precisely why they took this very strong\ndecision. It is possible that when His family heard the things being\nreported concerning what he was doing, they decided that Jesus must\nhave lost contact with reality and so they rushed out to locate Him\nto reduce the shame of the both the family and the family name.</strong></p><p><strong>The\narrival at the house.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus' family leave their home and arrive at the house where Jesus\nwas staying.

      "We want to look at the family of Jesus, and how they related to him, and how He related to them. Mark tells us of two important pieces of information about Jesus' family, divided by a very painful and terrible incident in the life of Jesus. Mark 3:22-30 reads. And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, \u201cHe is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.\u201d So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: \u201cHow can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come. In fact, no one can enter a strong man\u2019s house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man\u2019s house. Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.\u201d He said this because they were saying, \u201cHe has an impure spirit.\u201d Thee were terrible allegations."

That is why\nMatthew simply records it as the disciples asking a question</strong></p><p><strong>The\nquestion Jesus asked</strong></p><p><br/>\n<strong>There\nare a number of lessons we can learn from how Jesus dealt with the\ndisciples at this time. In order to address the problem Jesus asked\nthe question. The word Mark uses for ask is a very strong word\neperotao which means either(a) </strong>\n\n<strong>an\nespecially earnest enquiry, (b) an insistent pressing interrogation,\nor (c) enquiry with a certain legal formality about it. This was more\nthan just an off the cuff question, but a serious interrogation. It\nwas as if Jesus was demanding an answer off them. Sometimes we need\nto push people in order to get out what is really in their hearts.\nJesus knew that this was such an important issue and if he didn't\nbring it to the surface then the disciples would not be able to do\nthe ministry they had been called to.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nwaited until they were 'in the house' before he began to address the\nproblem. He didn't do it in public, but waited until he was alone\nwith them. It was in 'the house' a place where they felt secure and\nat home. Jesus was very direct in his questioning </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'What\nwere you arguing </strong></span>\n\n<span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>about?'</strong></span><strong>\nThis was more than a friendly chat. Dialogizomai the  word for\narguing, is from a word that can refer to simple conversation or to\nargument and dispute </strong>\n\n<strong>among\nparties. Here all the disciples were party to a dispute. The\nimperfect tense tells us that they kept on arguing. Over and over\nagain they kept picking at each other. We have recorded three\ndifferent occasions when the disciples argue about which of them\nwould be the greatest --here in Mark 9:46-48, just before Jesus'\nfinal ministry in Jerusalem (Matthew 20:20-28), and, amazingly, at\nthe Last Supper (Luke 22:24). The disciples had an ongoing problem\nwith who was the greatest, so Jesus needed to address</strong></p><p><strong>The\nresponse of the disciples</strong></p><p><strong>Mark\ntells us 'But they kept quiet.' This response reminds me of a typical\nteenager, when asked a question simply grunts, or says 'l don't\nknow.' The question Jesus asked made them feel uncomfortable, so\ninstead of being honest and open, they remained silent. The disciples\nunderstand the inappropriateness of their conversation. While Jesus\nwas telling them to expect his betrayal and death, they were thinking\nabout their place in the kingdom.</strong></p><p><br/>\n<strong>This\nwas a moment of high drama as an awkward silence descended </strong>\n\n<strong>upon\nthe room. I can just imagine the disciples looking at each other, as\nJesus patiently waits for an answer.\n\nThe word Mark uses for 'kept quiet' is the Greek word siopao, which\ncarries the idea of involuntary silence. I think this is important,\nwhile the disciples were arguing as they were going along the road\nthey had some sense of control over where the debate was going, they\ncould steer it, each one could manipulate it to their own advantage.\nBut now Jesus had entered the debate, not as a contributor but as a\none that would take control, revealing the real issues. This in turn\nmeans that the disciples had no more control over where the debate\nwas going, so in their vulnerability they retreat into silence, no\nlonger wishing to express their opinion. The fact that the silence\nwas involuntary indicates that the disciple were no longer in charge.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nforgive me for the times I have given you the silent treatment </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 1 Samuel  17:26-19:24</p>",

After some probing by Jesus the disciples eventually ask </strong>\n\n<strong>'Which\nof them would be the greatest?' We want to ask two questions about\nthe disciples' request. [al What! does it mean? [b] Why did they ask\nit? </strong></p><p><strong>What\ndoes it mean?</strong></p><p><strong>When\nthe disciples eventually asked Jesus 'Which of them would be the\ngreatest?' this was much more than a question, it was a window into\ntheir hearts and minds. It revealed an identity problem. These men\nbelieved that a person's identify, value and worth is evaluated by\nhow </strong>\n\n<strong>'great'\nthey are. They are looking for significance and importance, they long\nfor position and prestige, and they wanted to know who was 'top dog.'\nBecause of their insecurity they were caught up in the pursuit of\nstatus, the acclaim of others, always comparing themselves with\nothers. The insecurity that drove this question would make them a\nliability to the kingdom of God, it would cause them to abuse\npositions of power and manipulate others to meet their egotistical\ndesires, so Jesus needed to address Why did they ask it at this time?\nTo help us understand why the question 'Who is the greatest?' became\na significant issue in the hearts of the disciples at this time we\nneed to look at some of the background.</strong></p><p><strong>They\nused wrong categories to evaluate each other. The question they\n</strong>\n\n<strong>asked\nindicates that they viewed each other in terms of 'failure' or\n'success.' Peter, James and John had been up the mountain where they\nsaw Jesus transfigured. The other nine were at the foot of the\nmountain trying to hide their inability to cast out a demon by\narguing with the teachers of the law. Where the three on the mountain\nmore successful or more spiritual than the other nine? Did they start\nto compare themselves with one another?</strong></p><p><strong>Seeing\npeople in terms of 'failure' or 'success' is like using a ruler to\n</strong>\n\n<strong>measure\nwater, or scales to measure distance, it doesn't work. 'Failure' and\n'success' evaluations will encourage shame or pride, two negative\n</strong>\n\n<strong>and\ndangerous emotions. The question 'Who is the greatest?' means that we\nhave become judges of others, determining their worth in the light of\nhow we see ourselves. They avoided listening to what Jesus had to say\nby becoming self obsessed. When we look at the question 'Who is the\ngreatest?' in its immediate context it is very frightening. Look at\nMark 9:30-32 'They left </strong>\n\n<strong>that\nplace and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know\nwhere they were, because he was teaching his disciples. He said </strong>\n\n<strong>to\nthem. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'The\nSon of man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will\nkill him and after three days he will rise again,</strong></span><strong>\nbut they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him\nabout it.'</strong></p><p><strong>This\nis the second and shortest of three passion announcements in this\n</strong>\n\n<strong>Gospel\n(see 8:31, 10:33-34). The important thing for us to notice that the\ndisciples 'did not understand what he meant and was afraid to ask him\n</strong>\n\n<strong>about\nit.' The refusal to accept and the inability to understand Jesus'\nteaching about His cross encouraged the disciples to think\negotistically. It is possible that the desire for greatness was a\nreaction to the cross and a diversionary device to prevent them from\nthinking about it.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nchange my understanding of greatness</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 1Samuel 20-22</p>",

'diakonos' which\nrefers to one who runs errands and is synonymous with 'attendant' or\n'waiter.' Look carefully at what Jesus says here, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'the\nservant of all.'</strong></span><strong>\nThink about that, there is nobody unworthy of being served by us. I\nthink that is mind blowing. Diakonos is a humble role, and sometime\nwe wonder whether Jesus is serious when he says that the servant is\ngreat, but we have seen evidence that he is. Servant-people like the\nMother Theresa, inspire great affection and wield great influence.\nThey not only relieve the suffering of those whom they touch\ndirectly, but they also inspire greatness in people whom they have\nnever met. Their witness draws people to Christ and Christian\nservice.</strong></p><p><br/>\n<strong>But\nwhat kind of person would struggle with taking on the role of a\nservant? Someone, who is insecure, someone whose focus is getting his\nor her own needs met, someone who is not free in the inside. Our\ninability to express the attitude of a servant indicates that we\ndon't really </strong>\n\n<strong>understand\nwhat it means to be a Christian. Having the heart of a servant is not\na luxury that can be done without, but an essential requirement for\nlife.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nChild</strong></p><p><strong>Matthew\n18:2-3 tells 'He called a little child and had him stand among them.\n</strong>\n\n<strong>And\nhe said. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Unless\nyou change and become like little children you will never enter the\nkingdom of heaven. Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child\nis the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.' </strong></span><strong>Many\npeople read these words and jump to wrong conclusions. Their thinking\nis something like. 'We need to be as innocent as little children if\nwe are going to be great in the kingdom of heaven.' This\nunderstanding is wrong.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nJewish Scriptures do not support the argument that children were\nperceived as being innocent. Psalm 51:5 says 'Surely I was sinful </strong>\n\n<strong>at\nbirth sinful from the time my mother conceived me.' The Rabbi's\ntaught that a person could sin even before they were born. On one\n</strong>\n\n<strong>occasion\nthe disciples asked Jesus 'Rabbi who sinned this man or his parents\nthat he was born blind? They taught that a baby could sin in the\nwomb.</strong></p><p><strong>Once\ninnocence is lost, it is lost, and to ask a sinful grown man to\nbecome innocent again is asking the impossible.</strong></p><p><strong>So\nin what way do we need to become like little children?</strong></p><p><strong>In\nthe first-century Mediterranean culture, children were treated as\nproperty; they were possessions belonging to their fathers. 'Parents\nare right to ignore the child's point of view and to disregard the\nchild's feelings.' (Malina, 55). 'Children owe their lives to the\nparents, a debt that they can never adequately repay.' (153).\nChildren had no power, no privilege, and no prosperity. They lived\nonly through the good will and care provided to them by others. </strong><u><strong>The\nNew Interpreter's Bible</strong></u><strong>\nsaid that the child in this society was a 'non-person' and was\n'socially invisible' and, it would be unusual for a child to be\nregularly in the company of Jesus and his disciples (637)</strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhen Jesus says to us</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\nto become like little children</strong></span><strong>\nhe is saying 'l want you to be vulnerable and dependable so you can\ngrow in your capacity to receive love.' Little children have this\nnatural ability to receive love from others, and give love to others.\nIn Marks account we </strong>\n\n<strong>are\ntold that Jesus took the child in his arms. Intimacy with Jesus is\nonly possible if we are open or humble enough to receive love. But\nwhy do we as adults find it so difficult to receive love? Because of\nour lack of humility. The Greek word Matthew uses in 18:3 for humbles\nis </strong>\n\n<strong>tapeinoo,\nwhich in it's strongest form, means 'to humiliate.' If children were\nfull of pride and weren't willing to humiliate themselves they'd\nnever learn to walk or talk. What makes a child get up and try again\nafter they've had a clumsy fall, is it not the love and encouragement\nof others? So it is in the Christian life. Humility of heart makes us\nsensitive and open to the love of God, and that is true greatness.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay I have a child like capacity to receive your love.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 1 Samuel 23:1-25:311</p>",

I think to apply this to young children is a\nsecondary application, not it's primary application. Jesus was not\nthinking about children's ministry, or children per-say when he spoke\nthese words, rather he was continuing to address the issues of the\n</strong>\n\n<strong>disciples\npursuit for greatness.  The \u2018little ones\u2019 in this context are\nanyone who suffers because of the pursuit of greatness by an other. \nIn verses 5-11 Jesus describes the opposite heart attitude to what\nthe disciples expressed when they asked </strong>\n\n<strong>the\nquestion. 'Who is the greatest?' With this in mind then </strong></p><p><br/>\n<strong>How\ndo we avoid the self-seeking attitudes of the disciples?</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to receive with the right attitude. What did Jesus have in mind\nwhen he was speaking about receiving people? In the New Testament\nthere are two different words for receive. The most common Greek word\nis lambano, receive, here having the meaning 'take into one's\npossession, to acquire.' Archelaus went to Rome to receive his\nappointment as king over the opposition of his subjects who had also\nappealed to Rome. The word Jesus uses in this context is dechomai. It\nis used in the Greek as a term for those in love or an intimate\nembrace. Jesus was speaking of warmth here, an embracing and friendly\ncompassion from the heart.</strong></p><p><strong>What\nkind of person would be unable to embrace another? What kind of\nperson couldn't show this kind a warm authentic welcome? Someone\nwhose heart was set on their own agenda, someone whose focus was on\nthemselves.</strong></p><p><strong>How\nwe treat Jesus is seen in how we treat people. </strong><strong>'And\nwhoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.'\n</strong><strong>The\nkind of relationship we have with Jesus is seen in the kind of\nrelationships we have with those around us. If we are loving and kind\nto people, then that is an indication that we are expressing love to\nJesus. If we are cold and </strong>\n\n<strong>distant\nfrom people that is an indication that we are cold and distant\n</strong>\n\n<strong>towards\nJesus. We cannot be one way towards people and another way towards\nGod.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nmust receive people in Jesus' name. In the bible a person's name was\nmore than a title, it was an expression of their characters, so to\nreceive someone in Jesus' name is to receive someone as an expression\nof the character of Jesus. So our hearts and arms are open to all as\nan expression of the reality of Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus'\nwarning!!</strong></p><p><strong>Before\nwe look at this warning, there are a number of things we need to\nnotice.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nis alone with his disciples when he spoke these words. He was still\nin the house in Capernaum dealing with the sinful attitudes of his\ndisciples. It would be very easy for some to use these verses as a\nmeans of not taking responsibility for their own sin. Although Jesus\ntalks about others causing 'little ones to sin' he is not in any way\ntaking responsibility from the 'little one's' for their own sinful\nbehaviour. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'But\nif anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin,\nit would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his\nneck and be drowned in the depth of the sea.'</strong></span></p><p><u><strong>What\ndo we need to learn from this verse.</strong></u></p><p><strong>We\nare a)) people of influence, irrespective of our personality type,\nour </strong>\n\n<strong>abilities\nand our opportunities. We all have some kind of influence on others.\n\nThe word Jesus uses to describe the process of causing someone to sin\nis an interesting one in the Greek language skandalon. It actually\n</strong>\n\n<strong>started\nout to be a word that describes the part on a trap that you would use\nto put the bait. In fishing, it would be the fishing hook. In a\nmousetrap, it would be the little tab that sticks up where you put\nthe cheese on. Some older versions translated the word stumbling\nblock. Jesus is saying that every time someone is wrongly influenced\nby us leading him or her to sin, it is as if we have set a trap for\nthem. The sin that Jesus is referring to is very specific to this\ncontext, however this specific sin is the motive or the source of all\nother sin. So </strong>\n\n<strong>what\nspecific sin is Jesus alluding to in verse 6? I think Jesus is\ntalking about any sin that robs a person of their childlike\nvulnerability and dependence. When we become independent, ceasing to\nappreciate and enjoy the father's love we automatically veer towards\nsinful habits in order to find life and love. When people begin to\nlook for life and love through pursuing sinful habits, it is because\nthey have been robbed of freedom. The sin that Jesus speak of here\nalways robs people of freedom; they are caught -in a trap; a\nskandalon.</strong></p><p><strong>Every\ntime we encourage some to move away from grace, and begin to teach\nlegalism, we are becoming a stumbling block to others. It is the\n</strong>\n\n<strong>responsibility\nof every Christian leader to fight to maintain people's freedom in\nChrist. Jesus continues in v.6b by saying 'It would be better for him\nto have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in\nthe depth of the sea.' The type of 'millstone' to which Jesus\nreferred was the large stone that required a donkey or ox to turn. It\nusually weighed several hundred pounds. Romans sometimes practised\nthis form of execution. Jesus is implying that we would be better\ndead, than be the cause of someone loosing their freedom and their\nintimate relationship with God. Imagine the shock that came over the\ndisciples when they heard this. In their dispute over whom was the\n'greatest' they had just caused each other to sin or stumble by\ninciting envy, jealousy and anger. Jesus is like a good parent that\nsays; 'l don't mind what you do to me, but dear help you if you hurt\none of my children.'</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to take a step back and evaluate our lives and ministry in the\nlight of this verse. We need to ask what kind of influence we are. We\nwill be judged for our influence before we will be judged for our\ndeeds. To be passive, our inactivity does not mean that you are not\nsome kind of influence. Not to be lovingly involved with\nencouragement and </strong>\n\n<strong>affirmation\nin the life of others is to be stumbling stone. Do people know and\nlove Jesus more because they have met us.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay my life be a continual godly influence </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 1 Samuel 25:3-30:10</p>",

Having </strong>\n\n<strong>said\nthat, Jesus goes on to talk to the disciples about how they must act\ntowards their own sin, especially because they live in a fallen\nworld.</strong></p><p><strong>Living\nin a fallen world will not justify the sinful behaviour of the\nChristian. If we are the wrong kind of influence on people, causing\nthem </strong>\n\n<strong>to\nbe entrapped in some kind of sinful habit, we cannot blame our\ncircumstances, or the world in which we live. Those who are not free\nthemselves will lead others into sin and bondage. Twice in these\nverses Jesus uses the phrase 'causes you to </strong>\n\n<strong>sin'\nthis is the same word skandalon. In other words, if you are trapped\nyourself, it won't belong before you will start trapping others. We\nmust treat our own sin more seriously than anyone else's sin. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'If\nyour hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away and\nif your eye causes you to sin gouge it out and throw it away.' </strong></span><strong>Jesus\nis saying, be decisive and if need be, be desperate to cut sinful\nhabits out of your life.</strong></p><p><strong>Now\nthere is a problem we need to address. Maiming yourself will not make\nyou less sinful, because how we deal with our sin is a matter of our\nhearts. But if we have a right heart attitude towards our sin, then\nwe will go to desperate steps to be free from it. The words that\nJesus spoke here was not only extreme hyperbole but they have some\nhistorical background</strong></p><p><strong>In\n2 Maccabees 6-7 the story is told of the martyrdom of the elderly\nscribe Eleazar and the Jewish mother and her seven sons. Though\nfacing torture and death, Eleazar refuses to renounce his faith, even\nto pretend to do so, \"lest many of the young should suppose that\nEleazar in his 90th year has gone over to an alien religion, and\nthrough my pretence, for the sake of living a brief moment longer,\nthey should be led astray because of me\" (2 Macc 6:24-25; cf. 4\nMacc 6:12-23). In other words, Eleazar refuses to set a poor example\nand so become a stumbling-block for the Jewish youth of his day.\n\nIn the vivid expansion of this story found in 4 Maccabees, Eleazar\ntells his tormentors, \"I will not transgress the sacred oaths of\nmy ancestors concerning the keeping of the Law, not even if you gouge\nout my eyes </strong>\n\n<strong>and\nburn my entrails\" (4 Macc 5:30). So also in the case of the\nmother and her seven sons. Because they refuse to eat pork, they too\nface torture and death. The first son has his tongue cut out and his\nhands and feet cut off (2 Macc7:4). His brother tells the tyrant\nAntiochus, \"Gladly, for the sake of God, we let our bodily\nmembers be mutilated\" (4 Macc 10:20).</strong></p><p><strong>Thus,\nJesus' graphic descriptions are not only hyperbolic, they also call\nto mind the heroes of the faith, who by their devotion to the Law of\nGod set an example for others to follow. They were willing to give up\nlife and limb, rather than lapse into apostasy or lead others into\napostasy. As far as Jesus was concerned, his followers could not be\nany less committed. The fight against our own sin is really a fight\nfor real life. As we deal ruthlessly with our own sin Jesus says \u2018</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>we\nwill enter into life.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nAs we deal with our own sin, we discover that we enter into the life\nthat God has for us. This does not mean that we become legalistic and\nself-righteous. Rather we realise that the sin we so often resort to\nin order to find life, is the biggest threat to real life.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe are 'entering into life' if we are dealing honestly with our own\nsin, if we respond with rigour to remove the things that facilitate\nour sin, then we will be less likely to become a stumbling block to\nothers.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe are 'entering into life' if we are dealing honestly with our own\nsin, if we respond with rigour to remove the things that facilitate\nour sin, then we will be less likely to become a stumbling block to\nothers. We never intend to become stumbling block or a hindrance to\nothers, but we will be by default, if we are not rigorous in\nconfronting our own sin. </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nteach me to hate my sin more than anybody else's sin </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 2 Samuel 30:11-31:132 Samuel1-2</p>",

Often our hearts are\nflooded with insecurities, fears and anxieties. We struggle to accept\nwho we are, longing to be someone else. For many Christians \u2018Child\nof God\u2019 is more a title than an experience, it is more of a\ntheological concept than a dynamic reality.  The most important and\nsignificant thing about any Christian is that they are a Child of\nGod, this status is more important than their marriage, ministry,\nvocation, achievements or any other thing they may value highly. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nbasis of son-ship is knowing that you are truly loved. </strong></p><p><strong>Before\nwe look in depth at the temptation that Jesus faced in the wilderness\nwe need to look at how His father prepared Jesus for this ordeal, and\nhow the father planned it.  When Jesus was being </strong><strong>baptised,\na voice spoke from Heaven saying \u201cThis is my Son, whom I love; with\nhim I am well pleased.\u201d If Jesus was going to come through the\nordeal of the temptation then he would need to know deep within his\nheart that he was loved by his father</strong><strong>.\nThe love of the father, gave Jesus the security and wisdom he needed\nto discern and refuse the temptations that Satan would put before\nhim.  When Jesus heard his father declaring his love for him from\nheaven what was his father communicating? The word used for love is\nagapetos which means to be ultimately concerned for the welfare of\nthe one who is loved. It carries the idea of being loved deeply.\nOften we can have a superficial response to the deep love of God. We\ndon\u2019t let it penetrate our lives or marinate our hearts.  At this\npoint in Jesus\u2019 life, Jesus had done no teaching, nor done any\nmiracles; he just lived a quiet life with his family in Nazareth. Yet\nhe was completely loved by his father in heaven.  </strong></p><p><strong>As\nJesus endured the hunger and desolation of the wilderness he was\nacutely aware that he was loved.</strong></p><p><strong>God\nnot only prepared Jesus to face the gruelling ordeal of the\nwilderness. But He led him into it.   All three synoptic gospels give\nus the context of Jesus\u2019 temptation. Matthew says. \u201cThen Jesus\nwas led by the Spirit into the desert.\u201d In Luke we read \u201cJesus\nfull of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the\nSpirit in the desert.\u201d    Mark also gives a shorter account of\nJesus\u2019 Temptation, Mark says \u201cAt once the Spirit sent him out\ninto the desert.\u201d  There is a lot in this which we will look at\nlater, but for now notice that Jesus was loved then he was led. That\nis the way it needs to be.  It is very easy for any of us to become\nstressed or anxious about God\u2019s leading in our lives. We wonder\nwhat God wants us to do with our lives, we want some divine plan\nwritten out in the sky, but it will never happen. I think it is far\nmore important to know God\u2019s love than to know God\u2019s plans. And\nmaybe all the stress and anxiety around the whole area of Gods will\nfor our lives is the result of us not having a deep enough experience\nof His love.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that it is the knowledge of your love that enables me to\nface the difficulties of life</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 2 Samuel  3:1-6:11</p>",

Because Jesus was feeling secure in his father\u2019s\n\tlove he was able to handle the temptations of Satan.  </strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to make a comment about how some people understand the\ntemptation of Jesus in light of his Baptism. Many people see the\nTemptation of Jesus as a reaction of Satan to what Jesus\u2019 Father\nsaid to him when he was baptized. This in turn has lead to some\npeople creating a \u201ccause and effect theology\u201d which says\nsomething like. \u201cI must be doing something right because Satan is\nattacking me.\u201d They believe that the blessing of God makes them\nmore open to Satan\u2019s attacks. This is both dangerous and\ninconsistent with scripture.</strong></p><p><strong>To\n\tthink in these terms is to get your affirmation from Satan not from\n\tGod.</strong></p><p><strong>The\n\tbible teaches that Spiritual warfare is not Satan reacting to God,\n\tbut God pursuing Satan.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that you are the one who initiates spiritual warfare</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 2 Samuel  6:12-10:19</p>",

Often the struggle for\nself-acceptance is rooted in our inability to realize that we have\nlimitations, we don\u2019t have all the answers, we cant fix every\nproblem, we don\u2019t always know what to do in every situation.  The\nmindset of a child of God is one that is able to live with God given\nrestrictions and limitations.</strong></p><p><strong>The\ntemptations of Satan will cause us to doubt the goodness of God.\nJesus was hungry and his Father did not provide. Satan came along and\nsaid, \u201cDoes God really care?\u201d Jesus if you father cared for you\nand loved you then surely he would provide bread for you.   Sometimes\nin his love and great wisdom God decides not to meet our legitimate\nneeds. Or to put it another way, sometimes our greatest need is not\nto have our most obvious needs met. Once we begin to doubt God\u2019s\nlove we are giving the evil one a foothold in our lives. </strong></p><p><strong>So\nhow did Jesus respond to this temptation?  Jesus said</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u201cMan does not live by bread alone, but on every word that comes\nfrom the mouth of God.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\n Jesus\u2019 answer is incredible; it exposes the faulty thinking of the\ntempter. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nis saying, man needs more than bread to live. We have been made by\nGod and for God, so having our physical needs and desires met will\nnever make us content.  In saying that man does not live by bread\nalone, Jesus is saying that he really understands our humanity, he\nknows what makes humankind tick, he knows that mankind is more than a\nconsumer.  It is a satanic mindset that thinks that if I have all my\nphysical hungers and desires met then I will be complete.  Sometimes\nas children of God we are asked to carry a hunger, an unfulfilled\ndesire, an unmet need. As children of God there is no guarantee that\nall our prayers will be answered the way we want them to be.  We are\nnot promised a panacea, or a life free from suffering and pain. Why?\nBecause we need to learn to love God as children, we need to learn to\nlove him unconditionally, to learn to love Him no matter what, learn\nto love Him for Himself, for that is the truest quality of a son, and\nthe thing Satan fears most.       </strong></p><p><strong>Trusting\nGod is more important than food\u2014more important, in fact, than\n</strong><em><strong>anything\n</strong></em><strong>else\nin life. That is the Saviour\u2019s response. The devil is chiefly\nconcerned with filling His empty stomach, but Jesus is chiefly\nconcerned with trusting His Father who put Him in this spot in the\nfirst place. Dependence upon God in times of crisis is only possible\nif we are dependent when we are not in a crisis. One of the ways the\nchildren of God express their love for God is through depending on\nhim. When do we not need God? Many Christians live like functional\natheists, they have a rational belief in God, but in practice they\nare independent and live as if they were self-sufficient.  </strong></p><p><strong>As\nchildren of God we are designed to live in fellowship with God. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Man\ndoes not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the\nmouth of God.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nOften people use Jesus\u2019 use of the scriptures to encourage people\nto </strong><strong>memorise\nscripture, memorising scripture is a good thing, and should be\nencouraged. However, quoting the bible in the face of severe\ntemptation is not a magic formula that will cause the tempter to go\naway. What Jesus is doing here is expressing his understanding of\nessential principles that shaped his life and thinking. Many people\ncan quote the bible. But quoting the bible, and being shaped</strong><strong>\nby the bible are very different.  </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that my identity is important to you..</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 2 Samuel 17-19</p>",

We also need to remember that the\ngoal of the evil one is to rob us of our identity; he wants us to\ncease to live as children of God. </strong></p><p><sup><strong>5</strong></sup><strong>\nThen the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the\nhighest point of the temple. </strong><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><strong>\n\u201cIf you are the Son of God,\u201d he said, \u201cthrow yourself down. For\nit is written: \u201c\u2018He will command his angels concerning you, and\nthey will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike\nyour foot against a stone.\u2019 Jesus answered him, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cIt\nis also written: \u2018Do not put the Lord your God to the test.\u2019</strong></span></p><p><strong>On\nthe surface this may not appear to be a serious Temptation, I have\nnever been tempted to climb up to the top of a tall building and\njump, it has never crossed my mind. However, if we dig a bit deeper\nwe will discover how subtle this temptation is. To help us understand\nthis temptation let me mention a Jewish tradition that said that the\nMessiah would manifest himself by leaping from the pinnacle of the\ntemple.  Satan was tempting Jesus to make a name for himself. \u2018Jesus\ndo something spectacular and show the world how wonderful you really\nare.\u2019   We live in a world were lonely empty people long for fame.\nF</strong><strong>ame\nis the saddest substitute for genuineness in our society. Fame is\nadulation: admiration without love and commitment. Fame is achieved\nby jumping off temple walls while the crowd watches; it is a cheap\nalternative to the respect that can only be earned by consistently\nshowing up in people's lives with humility, honestly and with\ncompassion.  In our culture fame comes with being the most\noutrageous; because people crave for attention and love they pursue\nfame and notoriety in order to fulfil the haunting emptiness they\nfeel inside.</strong></p><p><strong>God\u2019s\nwork in our lives is more often a process than a spectacular event.  \n</strong></p><p><strong>Remember\nthe intention of Satan is to rob a person of their identity.  When\nreputation becomes more important than identity then we will cease to\nbe ourselves, and become the person others expect us to be. When\nreputation become more important than identity then will feel a\ngreater need to jump off pinnacles, or jump through hoops, or do\nanything else we can in order to be noticed or appreciated.  The\nsecurity that children of God should be experience will protect them\nfrom needing the applause of the public. We have all been here at\nsome stage in our lives, feeling that we must do certain things, or\nbe a certain kind of person; we must prove ourselves in order to be\naccepted. We can even find spiritual reasons for jumping off our\npinnacles. This temptation is anti-grace, because it basis acceptance\non performance.</strong></p><p><strong>But\nI think there is an even more serious intention behind this second\ntemptation. Satan wants to change how we relate to God. He wants us\nto view God as more of a \u2018fixer\u2019, than a father.  Jesus you jump\nand God will deal with the consequences.   Often as Christians we\nmake unwise decisions, we make foolish choices, and we come to God\nwith a demanding attitude, expecting him to clean up our mess. We\ndon\u2019t engage with God as a child would a loving, caring father, but\nwe see him as someone is to keep our lives sweet and easy, like a\ngenie in the bottle. </strong></p><p><strong><br/>\nGod\ntakes His relationship with you far too seriously for you just to use\nhim and view him as a fixer. God is not our lives janitor who is\nresponsible for clearing up after us. Viewing God this way will\ndiminish our ability to relate to him as his Children.  Approaching\nGod merely as a \u2018fixer,\u2019 or deliverer will prevent any desire or\nability to cultivate intimacy with him. </strong></p><p><strong>Satan\nwill always encourage us not to take responsibility for our self, and\nin turn this will cause us to become demanding of God, we will think\nin terms of God having to do certain things to prove his love. God if\nyou love me you will catch me when I jump.  And in getting caught in\nthis temptation Satan has managed to </strong><strong>trivialise\nour relationship with God. Being responsible is one of the ways we\nprotect our identities as the children of God. So instead of blaming\nothers for the mess our lives get in, and expecting God to clean up\nthe mess we take full responsibility for our own lives and the\ncondition of our hearts.</strong></p><p><strong>Satan\nwanted Jesus the seek vindication outside the purposes of God. Satan\nis saying, \u2018Ok Jesus let us see how dependant you really are on\nyour father, jump, take a dive and authenticate your claim.\u2019 There\nis something in all of us that wants, to be vindicated; we want\nothers to see that we are right. Often our identity and how we see\nourselves are so entwined with our needing to be seen as being right.\n </strong></p><p><strong>As\nchildren of God, you don\u2019t need to prove yourself; your identity,\nvalue or significance has nothing whatsoever to do with how others\nsee you or think about you.  \u201c</strong><strong>Will\nJesus use God's means of ambiguity, obedience, obscurity, weakness to\nachieve His purposes or will He use unworthy means such as power and\npublic acclaim to accomplish this noble end? E.R. Dalglish.  Source\nunnown </strong></p><p><strong>Satan\nmisuses the word of God, he quotes psalm 91:11-12.  He uses the bible\nlike a book of magic formula, he takes verses and miss applies them.\nGod has promised to care and protect us as we try to live for him in\nour normal everyday lives, however, when we become unwise, and begin\nto misuse the word of God to justify our foolish choices, we will\nhave to live with the consequences. </strong></p><p><strong>How\ndid Jesus resist this temptation? Jesus once again quotes from the\nbook of Deuteronomy 6:16. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cDo\nnot test the lord your God.\u201d </strong></span><strong>What\nis Jesus saying here?  When Jesus quoted this verse he did not quote\nthe last part of the verse. The whole verse reads \u201cDo not test the\nLord your God as you did in Massah.  At Massah the people </strong><em><strong>accused\n</strong></em><strong>Moses\nand God of impotence and indifference. They said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t\ntake care of us as we expect, God, we are not going to follow you any\nmore. You have to </strong><em><strong>prove</strong></em><strong>\nthat you are God and that you care for us!\u201d In other words, they\nchallenged God\u2019s power and His benevolence in spite of ample\nevidence to the contrary. Why did they do this? Because they believe\nGod should act according to </strong><em><strong>their</strong></em><strong>\nwill. They demonstrated that their faith depended entirely on what\nGod would </strong><em><strong>do</strong></em><strong>\nfor them, not on who God was. The test at Massah is a sign of\nrebellious disobedience, a refusal to accept the character of God as\nthe basis of obedience.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nhave all been to Massah; we have all been in the place where we make\ndemands of God, where we think he owes us something, where we made a\ncontractual agreement with Him.  \u2018God if you do this for me I will\nfollow you.\u2019 We all are guilty of coming to God with a demanding\nattitude asking that he prove himself. This kind of thinking is a\nsatanic trap, entered into through our refusal to respond spiritually\nto temptation.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank  you that you don\u2019t need to prove yourself to us.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 2 Samuel  20:1-22:34</p>",

For in his mind position of power and </strong><strong>honour</strong><strong>\nequals authority and influence. God the Father brought Jesus into a\nwilderness and Satan offers him the Kingdoms of the world. What a\ncontrast, Satan is trying to bring Jesus out of the wilderness his\nFather has chosen for him.   </strong></p><p><strong>Again,\nthe devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the\nkingdoms of the world and their splendour.</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>\u2018All\nthis I will give you\u2019, he said, \u2018if you will bow down and worship\nme.\u2019 </strong><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><strong>Jesus\nsaid to him,</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u2018Away from me, Satan!\u2019 For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your\nGod, and serve him only.</strong></span><strong>'</strong></p><p><strong>The\nthird temptation did not begin like the first two with the words, \u201cIf\nyou are the Son of God \u2026.\u201d As we will see, the devil seems to\nhave conceded for the moment that Jesus wanted to be an obedient son.\nSo the thrust of the third temptation was this: What would Jesus the\nSon be willing to do to establish the Kingdom of God on earth? </strong></p><p><strong>This\ntemptation exposes  that the way the</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>evil\none thinks is completely opposite to the way of the kingdom of God.\nSatan believed that position equalled authority and influence. Satan\nwas suggesting \u2018Jesus here is a wonderful opportunity for you to\nmake a difference to this evil corrupt world. Think of the changes\nyou could make, the laws you could pass, the evil you could crush if\nyou were king right here right now.\u2019  So often we can fall into the\nsame way of thinking, we believe if we were in a more important\nposition, or a more prominent situation we would make some real and\nlasting change.  If we were \u2018king for the day,\u2019 this would be a\ndifferent world.</strong></p><p><strong>Listen\nto these verses. Matthew 20:25=28</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\ncalled them together and said, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cYou\nknow that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their\nhigh officials exercise authority over them.</strong></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n</strong></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>Not\nso with you.

A\nperson can be in a position of power and authority, but not be an\ninfluence of change and good. Many people in Christian circles hold\npositions of </strong><strong>recognised</strong><strong>\nauthority, but their lives make no difference. In the New Testament\nthe Greek word for authority is exousia which carries the idea of\nfreedom or being free. In other words biblical authority and\ninfluence is expression of internal freedom. The greatest hindrance\nto real authority in a person is their lack of freedom. This causes\nus to ask the question, What are we slaves to?</strong></p><p><strong>Are\nwe slaves to our pride?  Do we have a desperate need for recognition?\n   Do we need a kingdom to massage our egos and make us feel good\nabout ourselves? Satan will never offer us all the kingdoms of the\nworld, but he will offer us some kind of kingdom that will appeal to\nour bondage and pride. Are we slaves to our ministry.  Some people in\nthe Christian context suffer from ministry addiction, their value and\nsignificance is rooted in their ministry. Their ministry is their\nkingdom. It is a place where they serve themselves instead of serving\nGod</strong></p><p><strong>There\nare thousands of things we can be slaves to, and our lack of freedom\nwill mean that we will not be free enough to serve. Jesus came to\nearth to be a servant not a king because he knew that in the kingdom\nof God a servant is the person who has the most influence. When we\nare not free, and live in bondage to some negative power, we will be\ndesperate for a position, a kingdom, and a crown.</strong></p><p><strong>Like\nthe other temptations that Satan put before Jesus, there was more to\nthis than what he is offering. He is offering Jesus a completely\nalternative way to live. He is offering Jesus an easier way to fulfil\nGod\u2019s purposes for his life.  It was the will of the Father that\nJesus would be King. See Psalm 24:7-10. Satan is saying \u2018Jesus I am\nmore than happy for you to be king of the whole earth, in fact you\nwont even have to suffer, all you have to do is stop living a life\nthat is totally Father centred and bow and worship me.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>R.G.V.\nTasker writes:</strong></p><p><strong>To\nescape the way of the cross by being disobedient to the vocation of\nthe suffering Servant despised and rejected by men, upon whom was to\nbe laid the iniquity of us all, was Jesus\u2019 greatest and most\npersistent temptation\u2026 .

The crosses that we should be carrying are the ongoing\nexpression of God\u2019s redeeming work in the world.

Any refusal on our part to not take up\nour cross and cling to a crown of glory, position and prestige,, will\nhave a dreadful effect t on the world in which we live.

Now, notice we are not saying that\nworship should be the foundation but worship is the foundation on\nwhich you are building your life. We are all worshipping something.\nEvery life here has something or someone at its centre that is\nworshipped.

So\nto accomplish this, he offers us an easier life so he can change what\nwe worship.  There are many subtle and discrete ways of bowing down\nto Satan and worshipping him, it is rarely an overt tangible act, and\nis usually expressed though idolatry.  </strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>What\nwe worship is the thing that defines who we are and how we live.

To worship is to give yourself to\nit. If we worship sex, we will run to sexual pleasure for comfort,\nsignificance and value, I won\u2019t feel loved, value or complete\nwithout sex.  If we worship power then we will have a desperate need\nto be in control, so you gossip or stab people in the back with cruel\nwords so you can hold onto a position and power.

Our experience and\nenjoyment as children of God is totally dependant on our worship of\nGod. Our identity as children of God has created within us an\nunceasing need to be worshippers of God.

      "When Jesus began the Sermon on the Mount, he began by talking about Beatitude people, those who were broken and dependent solely upon him for life. Jesus concludes his sermon by describing those who have moved away from being broken dependant people, to those who are self-assured and self- sufficient. In Christian ministry it is very easy to make this shift and not even notice it. Sometimes our service is a waste of time, it has no value.

    "html": "<p><strong>Before\nwe look at the story let me give you some background.</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nThis was at the time of the Passover. Passover was a very important\ntime for Jerusalem. The population of the city was approximately\n40,000, and because Passover was one of the major Jewish pilgrimages,\nduring this festival the population would increase to about 240,000\npeople, six times its normal amount. There was great anticipation for\nthose celebrating this festival, and the city would have been\nbuzzing. There would have been a carnival feel of celebration in the\nair. People would have been very excited hoping for a Messiah to come\nand deliver them, especially at this time of passover when they were\nremembering how God had delivered their forefathers from Egypt. If\never there was a time that nationalistic fervour would be whipped up\nand the people tempted to rebel against their Roman masters, it would\nhave been this week.</strong></p><p><strong>2.\nAlso at this time there was an other official entry into Jerusalem.\nAt this time Pilate came to town.  The coming of a provincial\ngovernor often took on the trappings of a stately, if not royal,\nprocession. He would have had an impressive entourage. The largest,\nmost formidable group to travel with a governor would have been the\nsoldiers under his command. It seems probable that both infantry and\nhorsemen would have accompanied Pilate from Caesarea. And because of\nthe massive increase in Jerusalem\u2019s population during the\nfestivals. These troops would have been used to put down previous\ndisturbances, and would try to prevent further disturbances. It is\nlikely that something in the order of one thousand troops would have\nbeen with Pilate.</strong></p><p><strong>3.\nUp to this point Jesus had refused to make a public deceleration of\nhis Messiah-ship. Often in Mark\u2019s Gospel when Jesus healed people\nhe would tell them not to say to anyone.  In Mark, Jesus never claims\npublicly to be the Messiah, and when people do recognize him as such,\nas in Peter\u2019s great confession in Mark 8.29 \u201cYou are the Christ\u201d\nor \u201cYou are the Messiah,\u201d Jesus strictly charges them to tell no\none about him. But now he wants people to see that he is the promised\nMessiah so he orchestrates this entry into Jerusalem to show them. \nThis is the first time in Mark\u2019s gospel that Jesus visited\nJerusalem. </strong></p><p><strong>4.\nSo Jesus sets the stage where he is going to reveal himself to the\nnation'</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Jesus\nsent two of his disciples and saying to them, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"Go\ninto the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you\nwill find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and\nbring it.

And some of those standing there said to\nthem, \"What are you doing, untying the colt?\"And they told\nthem what Jesus had said, and they let them go.\u2019 Mark 11:2-6</strong></p><p><strong>This\nwas a very suggestive act, it was an act of great prophetic\nsignificance. The prophet Zechariah had prophesied that their king\nwould come riding on the colt of a donkey. No one there would have\nmissed the significance of what was happening.

Luke 19:41 tells us\nthat as they got nearer to Jerusalem Jesus wept over it. The word\nwept klaio means to howl with sobbing and wailing. It was a word used\nto describe a loud expression of pain and sorrow. It was visible\ndistress. This is the same word used in Luke 22:62 where it said,\n\u2018Peter went out and wept bitterly.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>It\nis interesting that when we read about Jesus weeping at the grave of\nLazarus the word used there carries the idea of a more muted\nexpression of grief.  </strong></p><p><strong>As\nJesus looked over Jerusalem he was overwhelmed by the horror of what\nwas going to happen there.</strong></p><p><strong>Stop\nand listen to the howling sobs of the Son of God</strong></p><p><strong>Through\nhis tears he is saying,</strong></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>If\nyou had only recognized this day, and everything that was good for\nyou!

They\u2019ll smash you and your babies on the pavement.\nNot one stone will be left intact. All this because you didn\u2019t\nrecognize and welcome God\u2019s personal visit.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\n</strong><strong>Luke\n19:42 The Message</strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2019If\nyou had only recognized this day, and everything that was good for\nyou! But now it\u2019s too late.</strong></span><strong>\nThese were more than Jesus reflecting on how his ministry in\nJerusalem was not received, they were also a commentary on what was\nhappening at that moment, he was grieving about an on going\nrejection, a rejection that looked like acceptance. </strong></p><p><strong>What\nthe crowd was doing and what Jesus was saying did not add up. If you\nhad been standing on some roof top in Jerusalem watching the\nprocession you would of concluded that Jesus was loved, accepted and\nworshipped. This was an Isaiah 29:13 moment for Jesus.  \u2018The Lord\nsays: </strong><strong>\u201c</strong><strong>These\npeople come near to me with their mouth<br/>\nand honour me with their\nlips but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is based\non merely human rules they have been taught. </strong></p><p><strong>If\nonly the crowd had stopped and listened, if only they allowed their\nhearts to be touched by his heart, but they were too caught up in the\nmoment. They were crying out \u2018Hosanna\u2019 save us NOW. NOW NOW save\nus NOW, as Jesus cried painful tears they remained oblivious to his\nheart. We will come back to this, but first let me ask this question.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Have\nyou ever seen a man cry, a man break down in howling sobs. A dad, a\nhusband, a leader. I don\u2019t think it is something we can easily cope\nwith. It almost feels inappropriate or even \u2018wrong.\u2019 we don\u2019t\nlike it, it make us feel uncomfortable and embarrassed. Like the\ncrowd we would rather be \u2018hosanna-ing.\u2019  Save US NOW</strong></p><p><strong>2.\nPalm Sunday is about wrong expectations.</strong></p><p><strong>As\nthe crowds of people welcomed Jesus with singing, palm branches and\ncoats spread on the ground, they are pursuing their own agenda. They\nwanted a military Messiah,  someone who would deliver from the\noppression of Rome.  They saw Jesus as a means to an end.  As Jesus\nsobbed, as he drew near the city they were incapable of sharing his\npain or feeling his grief. They were blinded and hardened by their\nown agenda. SAVE US NOW.</strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes\nwe are not too different than is crowd. We can come to Jesus with our\nagenda, with our wants, with our desires. We may not be oppressed by\na foreign occupying army,  but more often than not all we want Jesus\nto do is to come and tidy up our lives, change our circumstances, and\nif he does, we would be willing to make him \u2018King for the day.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>Paul\ntalks in the book of Philippians, about the \u2018fellowship of his\nsufferings.\u2019 Part of what that means is we share the pain of his\nheart, we embrace his sorrow. We allow the sorrows of his heart to\nbecome contributing factors in defining our character\u2019s our\nlifestyles and our purposes.    For Jesus this entry into Jerusalem\nwas entry \u2018Into the valley of the shadow of death.\u2019 The dark\nshadow of the cross could not be eradicated by the joyful cheers of\nthe crowds. Three times Jesus had predicted his death, and this was\npart of the journey to the cross.</strong></p><p><strong>3.\nPsalm Sunday is about worship without devotion.</strong></p><p><strong>As\nthe pilgrims made their way to Jerusalem for the passover, on their\nway they would sing Hallel psalms which were psalms 113-118. as they\nentered the gates Jerusalem they would sing:-</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>Hosanna!\u201d</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>Blessed\nis he who comes in the name of the Lord!\u201d</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>Blessed\nis the coming kingdom of our father David!\u201d</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>Hosanna\nin the highest heaven!\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>quoting\nPsalm 118:25-26</strong></p><p><strong>Psalm\n118, a patriotic national hymn which celebrates the ancient victories\nof Israel over its enemies.  The message of the psalm is\nstraightforward. While Israel was surrounded by enemies as by a swarm\nof angry bees, God has delivered Israel from their wrath. The enemies\nrelied on their own power, but Israel's king relied on God alone.\nIsrael ought therefore to give thanks to God, because he is good and\nbecause his mercy has no end. When the choirs chant, \"blessed is\nhe that comes in the name of the Lord,\" they are welcoming a\nreal conqueror, a Nelson or a Churchill not an itinerant preacher\nwhose victories are spiritual and whose kingdom is heavenly. </strong></p><p><strong>Here\nis the point, they were using the language of worship without having\na heart for worship. They recited the verses they always recited at\nthis time. They politicized these verses believing that they promised\nmilitary deliverance from the Roman empire. Look at how they address\nJesus,</strong><strong>\nthe crowds welcome him as someone coming \u201cin the name of the Lord\u201d\nfrom </strong><u><a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/book-of-psalms-701125\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Psalms</strong></a></u><strong>\n</strong><strong>118:\n25-16. They also praise the coming of the \u201ckingdom of David,\u201d\nwhich isn\u2019t quite the same as the coming of the king. No one call\nhim Messiah, Son of God or Son of Man, or any of the titles\ntraditionally attributed to Jesus as Messiah. </strong></p><p><strong>At\nthis time their praise of Jesus was an expression of their own\nagendas through the misuse of scripture.  Someone has said, \u2018The\nexuberant crowds are chanting the right psalm even though they are\ndrawing the wrong conclusions from it.\u2019  </strong></p><p><strong>It\nis so easy to fall into the same kind of thinking, we often\nmiss-quote scripture, taking it out of context, miss applying it and\ninterpreting it to accommodate our agenda. Then we create a language\nor a way of speaking that can sound spiritual but is not rooted in\ntruth. As these people quoted well known verse, they were expressing\nmisunderstanding and a wrong view of Jesus rooted in their desire for\ntransformed circumstances rather than transformed hearts.</strong></p><p><strong>4.\nPsalm Sunday was about symbolic submission not real surrender.</strong></p><p><strong>Mark\ntells us </strong><strong>Many\npeople spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches\nthey had cut in the fields.</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>Why\nwould they spread their coats in the road? That was an old, ancient\ngesture, a custom that showed submission. \u201cYou can walk on me, you\ncan step on me, I\u2019m below your feet.\u201d Kings were always elevated\nand people were under their feet. And this was a way to symbolize\nthat. You can...you can walk all over me, I am submissive to you.\nThink about this, this act of \u2018submission,\u2019 was done in the heat\nof moment when an excited crowd was being motivated by a desire for a\npolitical revolution. This was not a thought through devotion where\nthe cost had been counted, and a commitment of absolute surrender\nmade no matter the outcome. This was just a symbolic submission that\nwould lead to nothing because it was fake.</strong></p><p><strong>You\ncould refer to this as tokenised devotion. It was not the real thing.\nMark wants us to see the contrast between these people in the crowd\nand Bartimaeus in the previous chapter, in verse 50 we read \u2018Throwing\nHis cloak aside he jumped up and came to Jesus.\u2019 </strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Being\na beggar was somewhat of an exclusive profession. Not everyone who\nwished was allowed to beg, for fear many lazy people would take up\nthe vocation and impose on the truly needy. In order to beg, you had\nto obtain a license from the authorities. The right to beg publicly\nrequired a person to present himself to the authorities and provide\ndocumented proof of his or her disability. If the evidence satisfied\nthe requirements to the satisfaction of the council, a begging\nlicense was issued. Bartimaeus had no doubt experienced this process.\nIn the 1</strong><sup><strong>st</strong></sup><strong>\ncentury AD, licenses did not come in the form of a paper certificate\nor a letter delivered by email, which one could carry in a wallet or\na pocket and present to authorities upon request. Rather, proof of\nyour begging license was issued in the form of clothing.\nSpecifically, a beggar was given a cloak of a certain style and\ncolour, which distinguished him/her from other professions. These\ncloaks were every bit as distinctive and identifiable as the high\npriests\u2019 linen garments and ephod. Whenever a beggar chose to\nattend to his occupation, he was required to don the beggar\u2019s cloak\nto validate his legitimacy. When Bartimaeus cast aside his cloak, he\ngave up more than just his outer garment, he gave up his privilege of\nbegging, which served as his life support system and his sole earning\npotential.\u2019 Jeff Myers I am Ministries </strong></p><p><strong>The\nword Mark uses for Bartimaeus throwing his cloak in 10:50 is only\nfound twice in the New Testament and </strong><strong>\u2014conveys\nthe thought of a reckless rejection of what is valuable. </strong><strong>When\nBartimaeus threw away his coat he was making a radical statement, he\nwas abandoning his old identity, he was throwing his source of\nsecurity and life as he knew it away. Bartimaeus had dreamed and\nlonged for a day like this a day when he could leave his old life\nbehind. Unlike the crowds who throw their cloaks on the road he was\nan individual who was not influenced by others. He was determined to\nget to Jesus no matter what others thought or said. He grasped the\nradical nature of following Jesus. </strong></p><p><strong>Tokenised\ndevotion lacks individualised expression, it is mass produced and is\ndependant on others and will never have the courage of throw away\ntheir old way of living Bartimaeus. </strong></p><p><strong>5.\nPalm Sunday is about an anticlimax</strong></p><p><strong>Look\nat what Mark says, \u2018Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the\ntemple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was\nalready late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.\u2019  This is one\nof those verses you could easily skim over. It is completely\nanticlimactic! Jesus is hailed as king by the crowds, so what does\nJesus do? Nothing. He does not confront the Roman oppressors,  He\ndoes not call people to arms. According to Mark all he does is look\naround the temple then goes to Bethany.

You\nsee if we are going to respond to Jesus in the way the crowds did,\nthen we too will have an anticlimactic experience of Jesus. Let me\nask you is your experience of Jesus an anticlimax? Is your Christian\nlife an anticlimax? Are you the kind of person who does not get too\nexcited about Him? You like the crowd are happy for Jesus to be your\nking for a day, king on your terms.

He\nspake not, but only looked round about upon all things, as if to view\nthe field on which He was to suffer and die. And now the shadows of\nevening were creeping up; and, weary and sad, He once more returned\nwith the twelve disciples to the shelter and rest of Bethany. Albert\nEdersheim.  </strong>\"Life\nand Times of Jesus the Messiah\".<br/>\nBook\n2 page 373</p><p><strong>What\nkind of king do you want Jesus to be?</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nplease break my heart with what breaks yours.</strong></p><p><strong>John\n17 is the longest prayer of Jesus in the bible, which can be divided\nup into three parts. In verses 1-5 Jesus prays for himself, in verses\n6-19 he prays for his disciples and in verses 20-26 he prays for the\nwhole church. So we want to look at the first part of this prayer.\nBefore we do that let me say that there are a number of reasons why\nwe should consider these verses.</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nThese verses capitulate Jesus\u2019 relationship with his father.  If we\nwant to know what it really means to love God, then these verses will\nhelp us. As Jesus prays He reveals his heart, He shows us how He\nlived and what He lived for. Understanding these verses will help us\nunderstand Jesus. The things we pray about ourselves, say a lot about\nwho we are and what we are living for.</strong></p><p><strong>2.\nThese verses will help us to love the father in the same way Jesus\ndid. I have been thinking a lot recently about how wonderful it would\nbe if we could have the same intense fervent love for God our father\nthat Jesus had.</strong></p><p><strong>Why\nare we so content with having an insipid, cold, predictable love for\nGod? Why are we so conditioned to settle for a mediocre love for God?\nWe should have a desire and an aspiration to love our Father God in\nthe same way Jesus did.  You may be thinking, that is impossible,\nJesus was different, he was God. You\u2019re right, but it was Jesus\u2019\nintense, fervent love for his father that made him human. Let me put\nthis way. The more we love God, the more human we become.  Not to\nlove God with all our hearts is to deny who we really are, and a\nrefusal to be who we should be.</strong></p><p><strong>3.\n These verses teach us the intimacy with God is not a luxury but an\nessential. Sadly so many people start their walk with Jesus well, but\nend badly, or not at all. They give up, they walk away, they jettison\ntheir faith, one of the reasons for this, [maybe the main reason.] is\nthey are trying to live a Christian life devoid of any intimacy with\nGod. Think about this,  trying to survive as a Christian, and\nremaining faithful to God is impossible without intimacy. Take\nintimacy out of our relationship with God, and you end up reducing\nChristianity to a set of cerebral dogmas that only require\nunemotional compliance, not the pursuit of a loving relationship.</strong></p><p><strong>4.\nThese verses teach us that Jesus\u2019 life was defined by his\nrelationship with his Father. At some level we choose what defines\nus. For example, I could choose to live as a disabled person. I could\nallow my disability to determine how I should view life, and control\nthe choices I make. Or sometimes we can be defined by the hurts of\nthe past, and we view ourselves as victims. Or we can be defined by\nour success. We may look at what we have achieved and develop a heart\nfull of pride. But Jesus\u2019 life teaches us, that healthy, wholesome\nhumanity can only be defined in the context of the fatherhood of God.\n What I am trying to say is our relationship with God the Father\nshould be the main thing that explains who we are. As Jesus\u2019\nrelationship with his father was the explanation for his life, so it\nshould be with us.</strong></p><p><strong>5.\nThe relationship Jesus had with Father gives us a practical\ndemonstration of \u2018eternal life.\u2019 Many people have a wrong\nunderstanding of eternal life, often eternal life is viewed as a life\nthat lasts for eternity, which is just one aspect of it, and in some\nways the least important aspect. Eternal life is knowing God in an\nintimate way.  It is a quality of life that is the result of\ncontinually growing in your knowledge and experience of God.</strong></p><p><strong>Let\nus look at these verses and try and understand the relationship Jesus\nhad with his Father.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\ngive me a capacity to love you like Jesus. </strong><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan 1 Kings 14-17</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 1 Kings 11:26-13:34 D ay</p>",

When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, \u201c Hosanna!\u201d Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!\u201d\u201cBlessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!\u201d\u2019Hosanna in the highest heaven!\u201d Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts.

In that day, they didn\u2019t\nmake jewellery to display the cross attractively on a necklace. That\nwould be like wearing a hangman\u2019s noose around your neck in our\nday! The cross was a place of shame, humiliation, and the most\nexcruciating form of execution known to man.

The more I have looked\nat the chapter, the more I am inclined to think that the giving,\npraying and fasting, which are extremely important, are secondary\nissues as far as Matthew 6 is concerned. There is a much more\nimportant issue that is not often picked up.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nyou read the whole Sermon on the Mount especially chapter 6 you will\nfind one word that is repeated 17 times, 11 of which are in chapter\n6.

How we live and what we live for is\ndetermined by our understanding of the fatherhood of God and the\nsecurity it produces in our lives.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay my spiritual disciplines grow out of me knowing you as my Father.</strong></p><p><strong>Before\nwe look at the chapter let us say a few things about God as our\nfather.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nthe Old Testament, the Jewish people had some kind of concept of God\nbeing a loving Father; however, this understanding of God was not\noften used. They saw God more as the Father of the nation, but not\nthe individual.  </strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus prayed he used the Aramaic word Abba for father.  This is a\nword that was only used in the context of the home; it carried the\nidea on intimacy and respect. The Jews of Jesus\u2019 time would have\nconversed in Aramaic or used Greek in everyday life, but they were\ntrained to pray in classical Hebrew. It was similar to some Catholics\nwho used to only pray in Latin. 1</strong></p><p><strong>They\nwould recite words but not necessarily understand what they meant.  </strong></p><p><strong>To\nthis day a Jewish boy coming to Bar mitzvah learns the correct\nresponses off by heart in Hebrew, even if he has no idea what he is\nsaying.  The Jewish people at the time of Christ would have had a\nconcept of God as a loving and protective father. It was not a\ncompletely new or alien concept to them but they rarely addressed God\nas \u201cFather\u201d in prayer, which Jesus almost always did.</strong></p><p><strong>What\nhappens if you were brought up in a family where the father figure\nwas not very good, or may not have even been there?  In Matthews\nGospel fathers are portrayed in a primarily negative light, often\nbeing the ones that must be left behind by the sons who were chosen\nto follow the commands of the kingdom of heaven. For example, in\n4:21\u201322 it is stated twice that the fishermen disciples leave their\nfather in the midst of their joint work to follow Jesus, literally\nleaving their father holding the un-mended nets. See 10:21, 34-37.\nMatthew wants to draw a contrast between failing earthly fathers and\na perfect heavenly father. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nbiblical times a persons\u2019 identity was always tied up with their\nfather, e.g. when Jesus first met Simon He said, \u2018You are Simon son\nof John you shall be called Peter\u2019. John 1.42. The designation \u2018son\nof\u2019 was like our surnames, it helped distinguish people who had the\nsame first name.</strong></p><p><strong>\"You\nsum up the whole of New Testament teaching in a single phrase, if you\nspeak of it as a revelation of the Fatherhood of the holy Creator. In\nthe same way, you sum up the whole of New Testament religion if you\ndescribe it as the knowledge of God as one's Holy Father.

Our father is looking for authenticity not\nperformance.</strong></p><p><strong>I\nshould also mention that we all have a love inspired need from time\nto time to shut the door to the world and everything else and be\nalone with God because we love him and long to give ourselves to him.\n</strong></p><p><strong>3.\nAs our Father, God wants to enrich our lives.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nis a very interesting play on words that we don\u2019t pick up in our\nEnglish translations. The word that is used for the reward that the\nhypocrite receives from other people, and the word for reward that is\nused to describe the father\u2019s response to authentic spirituality\nare different. The reward of the hypocrite is misthos which was used\nto describe a persons wage or salary, it is the same word used to\ndescribe a hired hand. Misthos describes the heart of the taker.\nThese people thought in terms of deserving something, they had a \u2018You\nowe me\u2019 mindset. They treat God like an employer who owes them\nsomething for their good behaviour. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nother word apodidomi reflects the heart of the giver. When the father\nrewards his children it is his deep expression of his pleasure and\ndelight. The father finds great joy and satisfaction. The rewards\nthat the father gives his children are to teach us about his heart.\nThey are a deep expression of God\u2019s satisfaction and pleasure. The\nreward is the Joy of God\u2019s heart flowing over into ours.

Ancient Jews had a very serious concern\nabout the burial of the dead. Josephus tells us in one of his\nwritings, that Jews were known for the fact that they did not leave\nthe dead unburied. The rabbis taught that the burial of the dead was\nconsidered a very solemn commandment. Any Jew who came across a\ncorpse that was unburied had an obligation to bury that person. In\nfact, the Mishnah, tells us that even if a high priest had\nencountered an unburied corpse, they would have an obligation to bury\nit, regardless of being defiled by the corpse.

But this Samaritan did not allow\nwhat others thought about him to define who he was or what he became.</strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes\nit is very difficult to break free from the negative things people\nbelieve and say about us, [and to us.]  Sometimes we are brought up\nto believe the worse about ourselves. \u2018I\u2019m only a Samaritan what\ndifference can I make?\u2019  This man allowed compassion for others to\nshape who he was, he could have had a chip on his shoulder, he could\nhave felt sorry for himself. He had lots of reasons not to get\ninvolved, but he couldn\u2019t walk past.  Maybe compassion for others\nis part of our healing process.</strong></p><p><strong>Compassion\nchanged how he saw others. This Samaritan saw the same things the\nPriest and the Levite saw. But how he saw him was very different. He\nsaw the man lying in the road as an opportunity for him to show\nmercy.  One commentator pointed out that t</strong><strong>he\nword mercy in English is the translation of the Greek word eleos.\nThis word has the same ultimate root as the old Greek word for oil,\nmore precisely, olive oil; a substance which was used extensively as\na soothing agent for bruises and minor wounds. The oil was poured\nonto the wound and gently massaged in, thus soothing, comforting and\nmaking whole the injured part.</strong><strong>\nTo show mercy entails being a soothing presence. Imagine having a\nlife that is soothing to others. </strong></p><p><strong>Compassion\nneeds to be practical and relevant, look at what the Samaritan did: -</strong></p><p><strong>a.\nHe went to him </strong></p><p><strong>b.\nand bandaged his wounds,</strong></p><p><strong>c.\n</strong><strong>pouring\non oil and wine. </strong></p><p><strong>D.\nThen he put the man on his own donkey, </strong></p><p><strong>e.\nbrought him to an inn </strong></p><p><strong>f.\nand took care of him.</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>The\nnext day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. </strong></p><p><strong>g.\nLook after him,\u2019 he said, </strong></p><p><strong>h.\n\u2018and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you\nmay have.</strong></p><p><strong>Co</strong><strong>mpassion\nwill cause you to have the heart of a servant. The elite and powerful\nsat on donkeys, the power-less servants lead them from the front.\nThrough the simple act of placing the power-less man on the donkey,\nand then leading the donkey and the man to the inn, the Samaritan\nturned deeply-held expectations of power upside down. </strong></p><p><strong>Compassion\nis the evidence of loving your enemy, the Hebrew word for neighbour\nin Leviticus 19:18 is ren, the two letters that make up that word\nwhen you take the vowels out, are the same two letters for the Hebrew\nword for enemy. So, in other words, Hebrew, which is written with\nconsonants and not any vowels, the two letters used for enemy and\nneighbour are the same two letters. So when the man asks the\nquestion, and Jesus says to him, what do you read in the law, there\nmight be a deeper meaning, a more subtle meaning. Namely, Jesus is\nasking him, do you see in the law love your neighbour as yourself, or\ndo you also see not just love your neighbour but love your enemy as\nyourself? In other words, there is a kind of a double meaning in the\nstatement. Whether or not that's the case we don\u2019t know, it's\ncertainly clear that in Luke, Jesus is using the parable of the Good\nSamaritan, to teach, not just about love of neighbour and love of\none's own friends and family, but love of strangers and even love of\nenemies. That's what mercy is all about.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nconcludes by asking. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018</strong></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>Which\nof these three do you think was a neighbour to the man who fell into\nthe hands of robbers?\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nJesus is asking which of the three,</strong><strong>\nLoves the Lord their God with all their heart and with all your soul\nand al their strength and with all their mind, and their </strong><strong>neighbour</strong><strong>\nas themselves?\u2019  Which of the three displayed, evidence of eternal\nlife?  The Samaritan.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nlive in a broken world, where a lot of humanity are living in a ditch\nwhere they are hurting and broken. The world needs to experience the\nradical nature of present day Samaritans who are overflowing with\ncompassion and generosity. This will only be possible when we Love\nthe Lord our God with all our heart and with all our soul and all our\nstrength and with all our mind, and our </strong><strong>neighbour</strong><strong>\nas ourselves.\u2019    </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay I be defined by compassion. </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 1 Chronicles 6:31-8:28</p>",

We know that there were more than 5000 people as Jesus\nhad fed them with two small fish and three barley loaves. Now there\nwas a change in mood, a change in atmosphere, the crowds that\nthronged to Jesus and wanted to make him King, were now leaving in\ntheir droves.

(This is a more\naccurate translation from the original text in Greek.) </strong><strong>This\nis one of those questions that is too big for a yes or no answer. \n</strong><strong>Jesus\nasked the question for their benefit in order that they would have an\nawareness of where they were in a spiritual sense. </strong><strong>This\nis a defining question, a question that is usually asked through the\ncrisis and pain of life. </strong></p><p><strong>Mostly\nthis question comes to us in a non-verbal way.  Life happens,\ndisappointment comes, prayers remain unanswered, and expectations are\nunmet. Faithfulness feels unrewarded, and you think, is it worth it? \nYou endeavour to live for God, without seeing much blessing or\nencouragement. So you think, \u2018Can I keep going?  Do I even want to\nkeep going?\u2019 The bread you hoped for never materialised, and like\nthe crowds that deserted Jesus, you feel angry, confused and unsure. \nAnd you think it would be easier to walk than to stay. </strong></p><p><strong>So\nin the context of our life, with all its unsettling doubt, its messy\nuncertainty and fearful apprehension Jesus comes to us and asks </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t want to leave too do you?</strong></span><strong>\n</strong><strong>\n How we answer this question portrays how we see our future, our\npriorities, the direction of our lives, what we will be living for\nand how we are intending to live.</strong></p><p><strong>So\nhow are we going to give a positive answer to this question? How is\nour faith going to survive the onslaught of pain, confusion and fear\nthat are an inevitable part of this life? How can we determine to\nbecome people of long-term, life-long faithfulness?  What can we do\nto prevent ourselves from becoming people who sacrifice integrity and\ncommitment to Jesus so we can follow the crowds?</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to relate to Jesus on the basis of appetite and hunger. We need\nto develop an attitude that constantly desires more of Him. </strong></p><p><strong>The\ncrowds that deserted Jesus were called disciples, but they did not\nhave the heart attitude of a disciple.  The essence of authentic\ndiscipleship is desire or hunger.  Listen to what Jesus had said:- </strong><strong><br/>\n</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Jesus\nsaid to them, John 6:53-59 </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cI\ntell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and\ndrink his blood, you have no life in you.

Life is messy, the bank account may\nbe empty, a family member may be dying, or a marriage may be falling\napart, so we see Jesus as the problem solver. We think that life\nequals my problems being solved, my bank account being full, my\nbusiness being successful, my children being Christians, my health\nbeing good, and we could go on and on.

We\nhave all thought that if we could achieve certain objectives, or\npossess certain objects then we would feel fulfilled, complete,\nwhole, and satisfied as people. We need a huge paradigm shift in our\nthinking. We need to be convinced that the life that we need to live,\nand the life that we want to live is only possible with the ongoing\nwork of God\u2019s Spirit within us. </strong></p><p><strong>Our\ncommitment and faithfulness to Jesus is related to how we respond and\nco-operate with the Holy Spirit. Faithfulness is the result of\ncharacter, and our character and its development is where the Holy\nSpirit does His greatest and most essential work.    </strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to grow in our knowledge of Jesus. </strong></p><p><strong>Let\nus look at how Peter responded to Jesus\u2019 question on behalf of the\nother disciples.  </strong><sup><strong>\u2018</strong></sup><strong>Simon\nPeter answered him, \u201cLord, to whom we shall go?

However in one sense faith is not enough, we will need\nsomething else. Before you jump to conclusion and think I am a\nheretic, let us look carefully at how Peter replied.   We have come\nto believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.\u201d We need\nto have faith and knowledge, to believe and know. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nfirst purpose of following Jesus is not to get to heaven, or to have\nyour life sorted, but it is to be transformed and freed from the\npower and guilt of sin so that you will have a new capacity to know\nHim. The point of salvation is to know God.  When the bible speaks of\neternal life it is not thinking about the longevity of life, rather\nit is referring to knowing God and being intimate with him. The\nultimate purpose of salvation is to know God.(John 17 v 3) If these\ncrowds of people really knew who Jesus was there is no way they would\nhave walked.  Knowledge of God is the bedrock of commitment.  Often\nwe can be lead astray because of our ignorance of God. We need to\nexperience a knowing that is beyond cerebral facts and theological\ndata. We need to have hearts that have been broken and healed by the\nreality of God.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to appreciate the glory of been chosen by Jesus so we can enter\ninto the process of transformation. The chapter ends with two verses\nthat seem a bit unconnected. </strong><strong>Then\nJesus replied, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cHave\nI not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!\u201d</strong></span><strong>\n</strong><strong>(He\nmeant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the\nTwelve, was later to betray him.</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p><strong>Many\npeople apply this verse to the topic of election and predestination,\nI am sure that these verses certainly allude to that, but there may\nbe a more pastoral and practical application.<br/>\nJesus wants these\ndisciples know that he had \u2018</strong><em><strong>eklegomai\u2019\nchosen them. The word carries the idea of being chosen from among\nmany so you can be with someone. </strong></em><strong>Let\nthe glory and wonder of that into your heart; let that truth stretch\nyour mind. Jesus decided to choose you so you could be with him.\nThink of the emotional and psychological benefits of grasping the\ntruth that you have not been ignored, or passed over, or forgotten,\nyou are not a mistake or an afterthought,  but chosen.  \u2018\u2019For he\nchose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy\u2026\u2019\nEphesians 1:4 Wow!

And in\nstaying the same he betrayed Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes\nwe need to stand back and reflect on how Jesus has chosen us, and be\noverwhelmed with awe and appreciation.  As we begin to realise and\nappreciate the wondrous glory and eternal joy that there is in the\nheart of God of his choice of us, we will begin to be transformed and\nchange from glory to glory.  If you are anything like me, then you\nwill listen to the negative lies that often play in our heads, we\nfind it difficult to see ourselves as God sees us. We sometimes think\nGod chooses the same way the computer geek is chosen for the sports\nteam, he is the last one to be picked because someone has to take\nhim. That is not how God chooses us.  God chooses us with a deep\nsense of exciting joy, because in his heart he has a passionate\nlonging for intimacy with us.  Gods choice of us is similar to how a\nman would choose his bride, the main difference would be that Gods\nlove for us will always surpass the love a man could have for his\nbride. </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nI pray that</strong><em><strong>\nI will never be like Judas who remained unchanged by your grace \n</strong></em><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan 1 Chronicles 11:13-15:29</strong></p>",

When Mark tells us the heavens were torn open, he\nwas alluding to a passage in the Old Testament, Isaiah 64:1-4</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Oh,\nthat you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains\nwould tremble before you! 2 As when fire sets twigs ablaze and causes\nwater to boil, </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>come\ndown to make your name known to your enemies and cause the nations to\nquake before you! 3 or when you did awesome things that we did not\nexpect,<br/>\nyou came down, and the mountains trembled before you. 4\nSince ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye\nhas seen any God besides you,<br/>\nwho acts on behalf of those who\nwait for him. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Isaiah\n64:1-4 is part of a longer prayer of lament recorded in Isaiah\n63:7-64:12. A lament is a prayer that cries out to God from the midst\nof desperate grief, pain, or any circumstance that seems out of\ncontrol. It vocalizes the hurt to God with the conviction, and the\nfaith, that God can, and will bring relief. A lament is not just the\nventing of frustration, but is a profound statement of faith in God\nfrom the midst of utter human hopelessness. The significance of a\nlament is that the worshipper prays in the midst of his pain. He\nbelieves that God cares about His condition and he has enough faith\nin God to trust Him with the outcome. When the heavens were torn open\nat the baptism of Jesus, it was God the father intervening into our\nhistory and pain. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>2.\nThe father expressed his love by affirming Jesus\u2019 identity. Knowing\nwho we are and accepting who we are can be a difficult process. Often\nhow we view ourselves is very different as to how God sees us.  The\nword that is used for love is agapetos, it describes one who is in a\nvery special relationship with another and in secular Greek is used\nmostly of a child, especially an only child to whom all the love of\nhis parents is given (e.g. used by the Father describing His only Son\nand Abraham describing his \"only son\" in </strong></em><u><a href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Gen%2022.2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>Ge\n22:2</strong></em></a></u><em><strong>).</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>In\nthe world in which we live, identity is usually tied to a persons\nabilities, achievements or successes. But biblically a persons\nidentity has nothing to do with what we do, or what we achieve, but\nhas everything to do with who we are.  When Jesus was being baptized,\nhe wasn't standing before his father with an impressive list of\nachievements that made him loveable. Jesus understood that he needed\nto receive his Father\u2019s love if he was going to accomplish his\nfather\u2019s will. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>For\nJesus accepting his identity was about him being able to be the\nperson his father saw him to be. How God sees us is the most\nimportant thing about us.  If you were to hear God speaking from\nheaven, and say \u2018you are my son, my daughter,\u2019 how would you\nreact?  Most of the time when we find ourselves far from God it can\nusually be traced back to some kind of identity crisis about how God\nsees us, or how we think God sees us. It is difficult to live as a\nchild of God if you do not believe you are a child of God.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>It\nis very interesting that immediately after the Father declared Jesus\nto be his Son, Jesus was taken into the wilderness where he was\ntempted by Satan. The whole point of the temptation was to question\nand undermine Jesus\u2019 identity. Three times he begins each\ntemptation with the same question, \u2018if you are the Son of God?\u2019\nHe was trying to do the complete opposite to Jesus, to what his\nfather was doing at his baptism. Temptation to sin is Satan\u2019s\nattempt to rob us of our identity.  </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Father\nthank you that 0ur identity is not about our achievements, but your\nlove for us.</strong></em></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 1 Chronicles 23:12-26:19</p>",

      "1. The father expressed his love for Jesus in a very clear and bold way. In Mark\u2019s account of the Baptism of Jesus we are told a very interesting thing., He says that the heavens were torn open. The word for torn is schizomenous, this is a violent word that means to tear or cleave and it requires determination and strength. The same word is used in Mark 15:38 talking about the curtain in the temple being torn in two. (Apparently the temple curtain was so heavy that it took 300 men to lift it.)"

Where our relationships, our words, our actions and\neverything else that goes to make up our lives as families, caused\nGod to know that he is loved.</strong></p><p><strong>However,\nfor some the family is far from a safe place, it is not a place of\nlove and joy.  Sometimes we open the door of our families to sinful\nbehaviour, to wrong influences, to loveless activities,. Sometimes we\nsacrifice family harmony to selfishness, and before long we our homes\nbecome places where God feels rejected or abandoned, our homes cease\nto be a loving nourishing, safe places. </strong></p><p><strong>At\nother times God sends circumstances into our lives that bring chaos,\nconfusion and fear. Sometimes there are people and families who are\ntrying their best to live for God, then God begins to move in their\nlives in ways they could never expect, and life just get more messy,\ndreams die, family life becomes difficult, relationships are\nstrained, the future looks bleak, and you you cant understand why God\nwould let all this happen.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nare going to take a look at the Christmas story and try to learn how\nwe can love God through our families.  We are going to look at the\nlife of Joseph, for he has a lot to teach us about loving God in the\ncontext of family.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nyou think about it for a moment their was nothing special about the\nfamily Jesus was born into, Yes Joseph was from the line of David,\nbut he was poor, and of very little influence. It seems like other\nfamilies would have been better place to prepared Jesus for his\nministry as the Son of God. It might have been better for the\nMessiah\u2014like the prophet Samuel and John the Baptist\u2014to grow up\nin a priestly household. He could have devoted days to prayer and the\nstudy of Scripture as well as had daily access to the temple\nprecincts. Or, perhaps the Messiah could have been raised within a\nPharisees household as was the Apostle Paul (Acts 23:6). This lay\nmovement was highly devoted to God and zealous for the application of\nOld Testament Scriptures (Torah and tradition) to daily living. \nHowever, God wanted His Son to live in an ordinary family, like ours</strong></p><p><strong>Joseph\nis a very interesting person, when we think of the Christmas story\nJoseph is probably the person who gets the least attention. We talk a\nlot about Mary, we are fascinated by the wise men, the shepherds and\nthe angles, but Joseph, we are incline to ignore him, we not incline\nto get too excited about him, we don\u2019t here too many sermons about\nhim. Yet Joseph teaches us a lot about how to love God, when family\nlife is not what you had hoped. How to love God when you hopes and\ndreams come crashing down? How to love God when your plans fall\napart? How to love God when your heart is full of fear?</strong></p><p><strong>It\nmay be, that one of the reasons why we find it easy to ignore Joseph\nis because he is a quiet man.

Understanding betrothal. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nfirst stage of the betrothal was finding a suitable spouse for the\nbride or bridegroom. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, this was\nmost often initiated by the families of the bride and groom. Though a\nyoung man could make his preference for a wife known to his family,\nhis parents may or may not have agreed to pursue his wishes. For the\nmost part, it was the responsibility of the parents to choose a\nsuitable spouse for their children. Young men and women were pledged\nto each other at ages as young as twelve or thirteen.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsecond stage was the betrothal ceremony. I remember when I was\ngrowing up I was often told that when the bible talked about being\nbetrothed it was like our engagement. It\u2019s not. The betrothal was\nentered into, it was absolutely binding. It lasted for one year.\nDuring that year the couple were known as man and wife, although they\nhad not the rights of man and wife. It could not be terminated in any\nother way than by divorce or death. In the Jewish law we frequently\nfind what is to us a curious phrase. A girl whose fianc\u00e9e had died\nduring the year of betrothal is called \"a virgin who is a\nwidow\". During the betrothal ceremony the Man gave his bride to\nbe a glass of wine, which only drank if she was prepared to\nabsolutely faithful and totally committed to him.   </strong></p><p><strong>So\nit was during this time that Mary conceived, and that is a problem,\nduring the betrothal period sexual relationships were not permitted,\neven though Mary and Joseph were known as husband and wife. What was\nJoseph going to do? How should he respond to this?</strong></p><p><strong>2.\nJoseph need to find the balance between justice and mercy.

But\nin the Bible </strong><em><strong>tzadeqah\n</strong></em><strong>refers\nto day-to-day living in which a person conducts </strong><em><strong>all\n</strong></em><strong>relationships\nin family and society with fairness, generosity, and equity.\u2019 Tim\nKeller\n</strong><u><a href=\"https://generositymonk.com/2016/09/14/tim-keller-biblical-righteousness-exhibits-generosity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>https://generositymonk.com/2016/09/14/tim-keller-biblical-righteousness-exhibits-generosity/</strong></a></u><strong>\naccessed 29/03/2025</strong></p><p><strong>John\nOrtberg speaking about tsaddiyq says \u2018Joseph did not eat unclean\nfood.

Matthew tells us \u2018that\nhe did not want to expose her to public disgrace.\u2019 Joseph believing\nthat Mary had been unfaithful to him, wanted to protect Mary, he\nwanted to shield her from public reticule.

He sees his wife pregnant, and he knows that he is not\nthe father, what is he feeling? Is he feeling angry? Humiliated?\nConfused? Betrayed? Did he feel all his hopes and dreams were gone?\nProbable, but he was also feeling love, and he does  not want Mary to\nbe publicly humiliated, so he is not going to drag her in front of a\npublic court to get his pound of flesh. Why not? Because he wants to\nprotect her, he wants to shield her. His love for Mary was greater\nthan his dreams, hopes and expectations. Therefore,  he decided to\ntake a course of action that would cause the least shame to Mary.  So\nhe chaoses to divorce her quietly.  How was that done? The two\nparties could get together before two or three witnesses and write\nout a private bill of which did not state the reason for the divorce\nsuch as is indicated in Deuteronomy 24.</strong></p><p><strong>I\nthink this is amazing, Joseph wants to do what is right, he wants to\nbe truthful, but not at the expense of love. If we stand for truth\nwithout expressing love then we are not really standing for truth. In\nevery family things arise that can cause this tension between doing\nwhat is right and showing love. </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that love and righteousness are always compatible</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 2 Chronicles 8:1-11:12</p>",

While not an\nincorrect translation of the word, enthymeomai has an alternate\nmeaning of \u201cbecoming angry\u201d.

To be known as an\nangry person is one of the saddest indictments anyone can ever\nreceive. It is hard living with an angry person, someone who uses\ntheir anger to control and manipulate. Members of their families have\nto walk on egg shells in case the angry person blows. The angry\nperson in the home is like the screaming toddler who needs to be the\ncentre of attention.

Let us look again at verses</strong></p><p><strong>19-20\nBecause Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not\nwant to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her\nquietly. 20 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord\nappeared to him in a dream and said, \u201cJoseph son of David, do not\nbe afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived\nin her is from the Holy Spirit. </strong></p><p><strong>Do\nyou notice anything strange about these two verses? They seem to be\nthe wrong way round. It would have been easier if the angel of the\nLord had come to Joseph before Mary had conceived, if the angel had\ncome and told Joseph what was going to happen, it would have made a\nlife a lot easier. That is what the angel Gabriel did with Mary. Mary\nthis is what is going to happen.  But with Joseph it is the other way\nround</strong></p><p><strong>One\nwriter wrote this.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>The\ncircumstances in which this mystery is revealed to him, precisely\nwhen he is reflecting on these things is not without significance.\nGod could have clearly spared him suffering by acquainting with the\ndivine plan at the same time,  for example, as he revealed it to the\nvirgin Mary. [In Luke\u2019s Gospel.] She too would have been spared the\nanguish of seeing Joseph suffer and of herself having to keep a\nsecrete that otherwise would have immediately resolved the problem.\nGod does not pay attention to the way men sees things\u2026   For some\ntime he permits Joseph to debate in anguished confusion,\nunderstanding nothing and seeing no clear way out, not knowing\nexactly what he ought to do in a situation as unforeseeable as it was\ndelicate and painful. It was only when arrived at an honourable\nsolution consonant with his imperfect knowledge of reality that God\nintervened by the means of an angel.. only then, and not earlier did\nGod let him know what was necessary for him in order to rectify his\nerroneous decision.\u2019 Douglas Wirth. Source unknown</strong></p><p><strong>Joseph\nwas full of fear, he knew that he could never marry Mary now, for to\ndo so would mean at least his reputation would have been ruined, and\npossibly his own family disown him, which would mean he would be\ndisinherited.  The interesting thing is this, God did nothing to\nchange the circumstances that cause Joseph to fear. In fact, God\ntells him to do the very thing he is afraid of. The angel went on to\nsay that his son would be called Immanuel which means God with us.  </strong></p><p><strong>Joseph\nI want you to do the very thing you are afraid to do, but I want you\nto know that I am Immanuel. Sometimes we would rather have changed\ncircumstances that know the reality of God with us.</strong></p><p><strong>J\nC Ryle writes that Immanuel promises to be \"with us daily to\npardon and forgive; with us daily to sanctify and strengthen; with us\ndaily to defend and keep; with us daily to lead and to guide; with us\nin sorrow, and with us in joy; with us in sickness, and with us in\nhealth; with us in life, and with us in death; with us in time, and\nwith us in eternity.\"  </strong></p><p><strong>The\nname Immanuel sums up God\u2019s heart, and all his purposes for his Son\nJesus, It encapsulates God\u2019s longing for us, it expresses our\ngreatest need and depicts the best source of courage and devotion. </strong></p><p><strong>Maybe\nyou can identify with Joseph, you have all these conflicting emotions\nraging in you heart, you feel disappointed and confused. The neat\nblack and white boxes you have used to contain your life have all\nbeen destroyed. Maybe, God is wrestling with you as he did with\nJoseph so you can build a home where Jesus will feel loved. At this\ntime God confirmed and challenged at the same time what Joseph\nbelieved and how he thought so he could embrace the mystery of the\nincarnation.</strong></p><p><strong>For\nJoseph this was a spiritual rite of passage, it was Gods way of\nbringing him to maturity, so he could provide a home where God feels\nloved.    </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that the life of Joseph teaches us that your presence in\nour lives is more important than a change in our circumstance.

At\nsurface level this verse is telling us that Joseph and Mary were not\nphysically intimate until after Jesus was born. However, in this\nverse there is a very important principle that is an essential for\nevery Christian marriage. \u2018Their will be times when we will have to\nsacrifices our desires, wants, \u2018needs\u2019 so that God can complete a\nwork he is doing in the life of your spouse.\u2019 This principle could\napply to many areas of life.</strong></p><p><strong>Marriage\nshould never be tit-for-tat. Do we hold our spouse accountable for\nmoral, upright behaviour? Yes! Do we withhold our love when we feel\nwe are not being loved? No! Christ\u2019s invitation to love is without\nlimits, without strings attached. We are called to love freely and\nsacrifice for our spouse sincerely. </strong></p><p><strong>Are\nwe prepared to make substantial and continuous sacrifice so God can\nproduce the life of Jesus in your spouse.   I wonder what kind of\nconcern or care do we have for the spiritual lives of those we are\nmarried to. I totally realise that we will never be held responsible\nfor an other persons spirituality, but we have a God given\nresponsibility to encourage and help others to grow and mature\nspiritually, especially those we love most.</strong></p><p><strong>For\nJoseph and Mary the very centre of their marriage was the activity of\nGod and the life of Jesus, and as Christians we should endeavour to\nhave the same in our homes and marriages. But how can we do that.</strong></p><p><strong>Here\nare a few suggestions.</strong></p><p><strong>a.\nPray about each others spiritual life and their relationship with\nGod, remember your spouses relationship with God is the most\nimportant thing in their lives.</strong></p><p><strong>b.\nPray together, not as some kind of formal activity, but\nspontaneously, for example, if you discussing something, or making\nplans, make prayer  a part of the discussion.</strong></p><p><strong>c.\nBe intentional in wanting to encourage your spouse spiritually, make\nit a deliberate choice. </strong></p><p><strong>d.\nexplore the word of God together, talk about what you hear in church,\nask questions of each other, share verses,</strong></p><p><strong>e.\noffer assistance.   Just ask is their anything I can do to help you.\nTake on practical task to free the other person up so they can go and\npray, or read, or do some kind of ministry.</strong></p><p><strong>f.\nPlan spiritual activities together, It could a morning praying\ntogether, or going on a retreat with friends, our it just might\nsomething like promising to pray for each other during a difficult\nday when you are apart</strong></p><p><strong>g.\nBe prepared to make sacrifices and go out of your way to encourage\nothers spiritually.</strong></p><p><strong>Joseph\ndisplayed a heart like Jesus. When you look at the life of Joseph you\nget the impression that he was the kind of man who did not care much\nfor the limelight, he didn\u2019t write any books, preach any sermons,\ndo any miraculous.  We are never told if he was especially gifted, or\nif he had accomplished great things. All we know is that he was a\ngodly quiet man who live the obscurity of Nazareth. Bringing up the\nSon of God in Nazareth was like the queen being brought up in an\nunknown and undesirable place. Nazareth was a small unimpressive\nplace with a bad reputation. Joseph choose to live there, see Matthew\n2:23</strong></p><p><strong>Joseph,\nlike Jesus did not live out of an ego. He knew that he could make a\ndifference by living a godly life. We are told about Jesus that\n\u2018although he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor.\u2019 2\nCorinthians 8:9. Joseph embodied this same kind of attitude. Being a\nfather to the Son of God could have caused him to look for notoriety,\nor popularity, but instead he embraced the obscurity of Nazareth.  I\nthink there is something very beautiful about humility in the home.\nHumility in the home makes the home a better place. </strong>\n\n<strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>Humility\nis found in many forms such as modesty, meekness, humbleness,\nlowliness of mind, and submission. These are all things that go\nagainst our natural desire to excel and be seen in this world. We are\noften driven by a need to be right, to be in charge and to come\nfirst, and time and again, we deceive ourselves into thinking that\nsettling for anything less is a sign of weakness. Writing about pride\nC,S, Lewis wrote  \u2018</strong><em><strong>According\nto Christian teachers, the essential vice, the utmost evil, is Pride.\nUnchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere flea\nbites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the\ndevil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God\nstate of mind\u2026\u2026 it is Pride which has been the chief cause of\nmisery in every nation and every family since the world began.\u2019\nSource unown</strong></em></p><p><strong>I\nthink the most important lesson we can learn from Joseph is that life\nis essentially about character, not ability, or achievement, or\nposition or even opportunity, but about who we are and what we are\nbecoming. Every thing Joseph was, we can be. We have all the\nopportunity to build families were God feels loved. We don\u2019t need\nto be rich or cleaver, or strong, or loud, we don\u2019t need to be\nspecially gifted, or be well connected. But, you do need to have a\nhumble love for righteousness and a heart that is prepared to make\nany sacrifice necessary so God can complete his work in the life of\nyour spouse.  We should aim to become families where God feels loved.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay our homes be places were we display encouraging humble love.\n</strong><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan. 2 Chronicles 24:15-28:17</strong></p>",

This is the second time Gabriel is mentioned in this\nchapter. The first time we meet him in the Temple in Jerusalem where\nhe met Zechariah. There could not be more of a contrast. The Temple,\nthe most important building in the nation, the heart of Jerusalem\naround which the life of the city revolved, compared with Nazareth.\nNazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament nor is it among the\nsixty-three villages of Galilee mentioned in the Hebrew Talmud, or\nthe forty-five mentioned by first-century Jewish historian Josephus,\nwho knew the area well. This was an insignificant little town. Its\npopulation is estimated to have been between one hundred and four\nhundred people, though its lack of mention in the Talmud and by\nJosephus might suggest that it was far smaller. It was not very\naccessible and was bypassed by the main trade routes. Nathaniel, one\nof the disciples asked the question, \u2018Can anything good come out of\nNazareth?\u2019 I read one source that claimed that Nazareth was a\nlocation where there was a ravine where the carcases of dead animals\nwere dumped, causing toxins to fill the air, causing illness and\ndisabilities among the population.   </strong></p><p><strong>The\nNativity story teaches us, that in our obscurity and isolation we\nneed an encounter with God. We need to meet God where we are at. </strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes\nwe can feel so isolated, so cut of from others we can be tempted to\nthink that our lives are of little if any consequence to God. Maybe\nyou feel that you are in \u2018Nazareth,\u2019 it may not be a geographical\nNazareth, but it may be a socially or emotional, it may be behind\nyour front door. We need to ask God to meet us in bleakness of our\nobscurity and realise that prestige, position and power are never\nnecessary for the purposes of God to be accomplished in our lives.  </strong></p><p><strong>In\na small cottage by the roadside in the village of Barvas lived two\nelderly women, Peggy and Christine Smith. They were eighty-four and\neighty-two years old. Peggy was blind and her sister almost bent\ndouble with arthritis.

She sent for\nthe minister, the Rev. James Murray MacKay, and told him what God had\nshown her, asking him to call his elders and deacons together for\nspecial times of waiting upon God. In the same district a group of\nmen praying in a barn experienced a foretaste of coming blessing.</strong></p><p><strong>Look\nat these words regarding the revival:- </strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>There\nwas a fear to count the converted, as ministers didn\u2019t want to fall\ninto David\u2019s sin of pride (1 Chron. 21:2). Though that was the\ngeneral attitude towards counting converts, we did find one record\nthat stated there were 20,000 converts during the first five\nweeks.\u2019<br/>\nDuncan Campbell indicated that 75% of those saved\nduring the Hebrides Revival were saved before they came to church. <br/>\n</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Plans\nare expendable.</strong></p><p><strong>Mary\nwas a young girl between the age of 12-15 who was betrothed to a man\ncalled Joseph.

He stayed at his father\u2019s home, where he would\nextend his father\u2019s home in preparation for bringing his bride\nhome. Add to the pressure, conception during the betrothal period\nwhich was considered an act of adultery and could be punishable by\ndeath. You could say that Gabriel's announcement trashed Mary\u2019s\nhopes, dreams and plans. In obeying God, Mary would have been\nmisjudged and wrongly perceived as shameful. The bible gives us no\nindication as to how Mary may have viewed the dramatic change and\ninterruption to her plans, but we can be sure that she would have\nfelt unprepared for such a dramatic turn of events. She did not ask\nfor or seek this role in God\u2019s plans; God has simply stepped into\nher life and brought her into his service.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nare two important things I want to say about this.</strong></p><p><strong>At\ntheir essence most of the plans we make, especially life changing\nplans, like getting married, getting a job, changing direction in\nlife are emotionally based decisions. They are more than cold facts\nwritten on a white board, and for the most part they come from an\nemotional place, and are full of emotional expectations. So when\nGod\u2019s will begins to threaten our hopes and plans we really\nstruggle. We struggle because we are not unemotional robots, we\nstruggle because our hopes for the future have caused us to become\nexcited about our plans. This is what you could call \u2018 the nativity\nstruggle.\u2019 </strong></p><p><strong>Have\nyou ever thought that Mary could have said no, just as much as we\nhave the freedom to say no? </strong></p><p><strong>There\nwill be times in our lives when we will have to engage in \u2018the\nnativity struggle.\u2019 when we will have to decide, do I want to do\nlife my way, or Gods way? When we have to decide if God\u2019s eternal\npurposes are more important than our temporary agenda.</strong></p><p><strong>Also\nwe need to come to a heart conviction that it is better to live a\ndifficult, complex life within the will of God, than to life in the\nsafe monotony of my own existence. There were lots of reasons why\nMary could have said no, could have played it safe, but she had the\ncourage to see beyond the boundaries of her emotional safe plans and\nher obscurity, and choose the difficult path because it was the best.\n\u2018The Nativity struggle\u2019 is having the courage not play it safe.\n\u2018The Nativity struggle\u2019 is to let encounters with God determine\nthe course of your life so His Son can be formed in you.     </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nI pray that the obscurity of my life will not become a comfort zone\nwhere I hide </strong></p><p><strong>Bible\nreading plan </strong>2\nChronicles 32:1-35:19</p>",

Being over\nfamiliar, we are inclined to think that our understanding must be\nright.</strong></p><p><strong>2.\nWhen you read Luke\u2019s account of the birth of Jesus, he does not say\nmuch about it. Someone has called Luke's record \u2018A little duel of\neconomical story telling.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>There\nare 1151 verses in the book of Luke, 7 of these verse deal with the\ncircumstances surrounding Jesus\u2019 birth. Only one verse deals with\nHis actual birth itself. (Luke gives us a lot more details about the\nShepherds.) His account feels very ordinary, there was nothing\nmiraculous about Jesus\u2019 birth. His conception was miraculous, the\nannouncement to the Shepherds was miraculous, but the birth itself\nhappened in a very ordinary, down to earth way, there were no\nmiracles, no angels, just a teenage girl giving birth.</strong></p><p><strong>3.\nThe fact that the bible gives us so few details regarding Jesus\u2019\nbirth has led to lot of speculation, assumptions and misinformation.\nOne of the reasons why we  misunderstand the Christmas story, is\nbecause of a novel about the birth of Jesus known as </strong><strong>The\nProtevangelium of James, which was</strong><strong>\npublished 200 years after the life of Jesus. </strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>In\nthe novel, as they approach Bethlehem, Mary says to Joseph, \u201cJoseph,\ntake me down from the ass, for the child within me presses me, to\ncome forth.\u201d7 Responding to this request, Joseph leaves Mary in a\ncave and rushes off to Bethlehem to find a midwife.

A pregnant teenager\ngiving birth in a cave/stable. Maybe the fact that we think Jesus was\nborn in a stable means we can keep him at a safe distance, from\nourselves, and we have no way of applying a stable birth scenario to\nour every day lives.

One large room which was divided\nin two, a lower part and a higher part. The family lived and slept in\nthe higher bit of the room and the animals were kept in the lower\npart of the room, they were kept indoors at night for safety, and to\nprovide some more heat for the family. The upper part of the room\noften had a built-in manger which was assessable to the animals for\nfeeding.  </strong></p><p><strong>B,\nMany homes had a second room called the \u2019Katalyma,\u2019 and this is\nthe word Luke uses for Inn. The word  Katalyma was used to describe\nthe guest room.  This is the same word used in Luke 22:11 and Mark\n14:14 to describe the upper room where Jesus eat the passover with\nhis disciples. The best translation of the word is \u2018a place to\nstay.\u2019 In the parable of the Good Samaritan Luke uses the word\n</strong><strong>pandocheion,\nwhich refers specifically to an inn for travellers (cf. 10:34).</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>So,\nwe never read of an Inn-keeper, nor is there any biblical evidence of\nJoseph or Mary being turned away from anywhere or being refused\naccommodation. So is is more likely that Jesus was born in the large\nfamily room that was adjoined to where the animals were kept at\nnight.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank that Jesus has come to be part of our families. </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Nehemiah 2-5</p>",

But\nthe Jesus that is born in the \u2018Katalyma.\u2019 guest room, well he\nbecomes a guest. We are so glad that he comes and stays for a while,\nwe make a sporadic effort to accommodate him, we have time when we go\nout of our way to fit our lives around him. However, treating him as\na guest means that at its essence the majority of our lives is not\nreally about him. Being a guest in someone\u2019s home is lovely but it\nis never the same as being part of the family, a guest will never\nhave the same freedom as a member of the family.</strong></p><p><strong>I\nthink it is so easy for anyone of us to put Jesus into the stable or\nthe guest room in order to protect and control our own space. One of\nthe first lessons we learn from the incarnation of Jesus is that he\nwants to sanctify the ordinariness of family life. The last place he\nwants to be is in a stable or a guest room, rather he wants to be,\n[and we need him to be] at the very heart of family life.</strong></p><p><strong>Let\nus take a step back and think about the implications of what this\nmeans.</strong></p><p><strong>a.\nIs our family life centred around Jesus?  This is not an easy\nquestion to hear or to answer. Having a Christ centred family will\nonly happen if it is intentional, it will never happen by default?\nHow do we know if we have Christ centred family? One of the ways to\nanswer that question is to ask ourselves if our lives as a family\nwould be very different if we had no knowledge of Jesus or his\npresence. In other words, would/could our family life survive with\nlittle or no acknowledgement of Jesus? Has the reality of Jesus at\nthe heart of our home become an absolute essential for our families\nand marriages.</strong></p><p><strong>b.\nAre our families a place where there is space for the life of Jesus\nto grow? Jesus was born in the heart if the family, not in the stable\nor the guest room, and it was in the context of the family that Jesus\ngrew. As parents, Mary and Joseph were continually learning and\ndiscovering new things about Jesus. I like that. As families we need\na corporate experience of discovering Jesus. I think at times we have\nover individualised our relationship with Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nhave heard of married couples who are happy to do their own thing. He\ndoes his thing with his mates, and she does her thing with her\nfriends, and occasionally they do something together. The reason I\nmentioned this, is because for the most part when it comes to our\nspiritual lives, there can be an over independence. We are like the\nabove mentioned couple. We do our own \u2018spiritual\u2019 thing during\nthe week. Then we go to church together on a Sunday. To be a\nChristian family which is Christ centred is about having a shared\nexperience of Jesus in the context of our homes. Just let me say that\nbeing a church going family is very different than being a Christian\nfamily.</strong></p><p><strong>c.\nAre our families a place that is dominated by love. Could you say\nthat love is the main thing that continually characterises you family\nlife?</strong></p><p><strong>There\nis something fascinating about this passage that is very easily\nmissed. Look how Luke describes Mary, \u2018</strong><strong>He\nwent there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to\nhim.\u2019 He does not call Mary his wife, they were not married at this\ntime. We know from Matthew 1:25. \u2018But he did not consummate their\nmarriage until she gave birth to a son. This is important because\nconsummation was part of the wedding celebration, and Joseph did not\nwant to be identified as Jesus\u2019 biological father, so they probably\ngot married after Jesus birth.</strong></p><p><strong>So\nthink how radical Joseph\u2019s love for Mary must had been. To\ncompletely accept her, never ashamed to be seen with her. His\nacceptance of Mary was deeply embedded in the reality of the life of\nJesus. An authentic Christian home is where people are accepted\nbecause of the life of Jesus. Sadly in many homes that claim to be\nChristian, there is control, not acceptance, manipulation, not\nacceptance, a desire to change others not acceptance, resentment not\nacceptance. There are homes were the experience of love is the\nunusual rather than normal, where being served is more important than\nserving. And we have excluded Jesus to either the stable or the guest\nroom. When our lives as families is defined by Jesus and his love,\nthen we will be better resourced to deal with the inevitability of\ntension, stress and pain.   </strong></p><p><strong>A\nChristian author, Kaylene Yoder wrote, </strong><strong>\u2018The\ncondition of our hearts will shape the culture of our home.\u2019  </strong></p><p><strong>4.If\nthe authentic life of Jesus is the essence of our homes it will\naffect those outside our home.</strong></p><p><strong>As\nwe have said their was nothing miraculous about Jesus\u2019 birth. It\nwas a very ordinary birth. Mary had to go through all the usual\nlabour pains in order to bring Jesus into the world. But what was\nmiraculous was what happened in the fields of Bethlehem.

It can be divided into two sections. In\nthe first section Mary talks about God\u2019s dealings with herself\n(Luke 1:46-49) and in the second she speaks about God\u2019s concern for\njustice for the world. (Luke1:50-55) I want to look at the first part\nof the song, and to do that I want to ask a question.</strong></p><p><strong>How\ncan we prepare ourselves for the future? Or to put it another way,\nWhat preparation or changes do you need to make in your thinking so\nyou can cope with the future? </strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme share a story with you.</strong></p><p><strong>During\nthe British Antarctic Expedition of 1910-13, \u2013 Captain Robert Scott\nand four others tried to be the first to reach the South Pole,\nhowever, Roald Amundsen beat them by just over a month. While\nAmundsen and his men came back safely, Scott's party all died on the\nreturn from their expedition. - What led to the death of Scott's\nparty?</strong></p><p><strong>There\nwere a number of reasons why Scott failed. </strong></p><p><strong>Scott\u2019s\ncumbersome and complex transport plans were an underlying cause of\nthe disaster. They involved a team of dogs, 19 Manchurian ponies, and\n3 experimental (and expensive) motor sledges. Ponies are unsuited to\nAntarctica. They suffered in the cold weather, delaying the start of\nScott\u2019s journey. Worse still, many of the animals purchased were\nold and worn out. 2 never reached Antarctica and 6 died on a\npreparatory journey. The motor sledges were even less successful.</strong></p><p><strong>Another\nmajor problem was the fact that Scott\u2019s team\u2019s rations were\ndeficient in various nutrients, such as vitamin C, which</strong><strong>\ncaused them to suffer from scurvy. </strong><strong>Scott\nmade decisions that caused further problems. He had originally\nplanned to travel to the pole with three other men. At the last\nminute, he took an extra person \u2013 Bowers. This made the tent\ncramped and increased the time it took to cook meals. It also caused\nlogistical complications, as all the food supplies had been packed\nfor groups of four.</strong><strong>\n Almost all water on the continent is frozen. To get a drink, Scott\nand his companions had to melt ice and snow on their paraffin-burning\nstove. Fuel supplies were thus vital to keeping explorers hydrated.\nTo reduce weight, the explorers left much of their fuel in cans in\ndepots on their way to the pole, planning to pick these up on the way\nback. The problem was, that the cans leaked due to faulty seals. On\nthe way back from the pole, Scott found that many contained much less\nfuel than expected. Without enough water, the explorers became\nincreasingly dehydrated, hampering their physical and mental\nperformance. To add to all this, there was a particularly harsh\nwinter that the explorers were not prepared for.  </strong></p><p><strong>Let\u2019s\nthink of the challenge that Mary faced. A much greater challenge than\ngoing to the South Pole, she had to raise The Son of God!!!</strong></p><p><strong>Unlike\nScott and his team Mary made the right preparations.  We are going to\nlook at Mary\u2019s song which</strong><strong>\ngives us some insight as to how she saw herself, and how she built\nher life on a theological foundation so she could embrace the future\nthat God had called her to. </strong></p><p><strong>It\nis so easy for any of us to go into life ill prepared. I understand\nwe cannot plan for the unexpected, life happens, trouble comes and\nsometimes we can feel overwhelmed. However, there is a lot we can do,\nand one of the things we should do, is build our lives on a solid\ntheological foundation so we will have the spiritual  resources to\ncope with the future. </strong></p><p><strong>Often\nour spiritual lives are the last thing we think of when it comes to\nus making preparations for the future. We make plans around our\nfamilies, our finances, our occupations, our leisure time, we prepare\nas much as we can for these things, and it is right that we do so.\nHowever, we rarely think that we need to be prepared spiritually for\nthe future God is calling us to. It is so easy for any of us to go\ninto the future not having prepared ourselves spiritually, and when\nlife happens, pain comes, and God\u2019s will seems too demanding, we\ndon\u2019t have the resilience or resources to cope.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me to prepare spiritually for the future.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Nehemiah 8:9-11:21</p>",

Often there are two sinful extremes as to\nhow we perceive ourselves. We can either be full of pride and\nindependent, or we can be full of shame and believe that we are of no\nvalue and of no use. These two sinful postures are self-centred and\nthe antithesis to how Mary viewed herself. </strong></p><p><strong>Look\nhow she describes herself. \u2018</strong><strong>For\nhe took notice of his lowly servant girl, or his bound slave.</strong><strong>\nShe saw herself as HIS servant. HIS servant is a good way to\nunderstand the kind of people we need to be if we are going to have a\nproper attitude towards our future in God. This is not the first time\nMary understood herself to be a doule, see Luke 1::38. She had\ndeveloped the mindset of a servant.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Ralph\nEarl says,</strong></strong><strong>\n\u2018That the Greek </strong><strong><strong>doule\nbound servant </strong></strong><strong>signifies\nthat \"Mary placed herself completely at God's disposal, even\nthough she knew the outcome would bring shame and disgrace on her in\nthe eyes of her neighbours.\" (Word Meanings)</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>This\nword conveys the idea of the slave's close, binding ties with the\nmaster, belonging to him, obligated (desirous) to do his will. Her\nwill is ideally all together subsumed in the will of the master.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nare all in a continual struggle between entitlement and servant-hood.\n We can go into the future with a must have attitude, I deserve, I am\nentitled. Or we can be like Mary, recognise that life is not about us\nbut about Him. We can have a servant attitude that says \u2018Lord no\nmatter what, I want to be radically submitted and committed to you.  </strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>David\nLivingstone was a pioneer missionary to Africa, who walked over\n29,000 miles. His wife died early in their ministry and he faced\nstiff opposition from other Christians. He prayed, \u201cSend me\nanywhere, only go with me. Lay any burden on me, only sustain me.\nSever any ties but the tie that binds me to Your service and to Your\nheart.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>Mary\nunderstood that the only way she could embrace the future purposes of\nGod, was to have an authentic heart of a servant.</strong></p><p><strong>She\ndid not allow her place in society to determine God\u2019s future for.</strong></p><p><strong>As\nwe read the Magnificat we can see that Mary was aware of two things\nabout her life. Her status and God\u2019s grace.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nshe speaks about God being mindful of her humble state, she was\nreferring to her social and economic deprivation, </strong><strong>The\nword Luke uses for \u2019humble estate.\u2019 comes from the Greek word\n</strong><strong><strong>tapeino\nwhich was </strong></strong><strong>almost\nused exclusively in a derisive way, most commonly of a slave.</strong><strong>\nTry and think, if Mary lived in your town or village, she would\nprobably live in the most deprived part. If she had a job, it would\nhad been very lowed paid. She would have had no power, position or\nstatus and would have been unnoticed for her unremarkable life. She\nwould probably have need of the foodbank, and may have found it\ndifficult to fit into the middle class church. Yet, this poor,\npregnant teenager, faced the future with great hope and high\nexpectations. How was she able to think beyond her circumstances? How\nwas she able to see past the difficult reality of her present\ncircumstances? She was conscious not only of her low status, but also\nthat she was blessed. In fact all generations would call her blessed.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nour thinking we often equate being blessed with the improvement of\nour circumstances. So we get money to pay a bill, or we get the job\nwe were hoping for, our we meet the love of our lives. These are all\nblessings and we should be thankful for them, however, for Mary, the\nblessing of God did not improve her circumstances, in fact they made\nthem more difficult. Yet she felt blessed. The blessing she was\nreferring to was more profound, more significant and more life\nchanging than circumstantial change and dreams fulfilled. </strong></p><p><strong>At\nthis time in Jewish history there was a strong theological belief\nthat the rich were blessed and the poor were cursed. And here was\nMary able to see outside the confines of common theology to recognise\nthat being blessed by God was much bigger than having our needs and\ndesires met.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword Luke uses for blessed in verse 48 is only found twice in the New\nTestament, here and in James 5:11. The idea behind it is, to be\nconsidered blessed by God. It is like Mary was saying, \u2018God has\ncalled me blessed and the reason I am blessed is because I have the\nhonour of submitting to His will so he can accomplish His purposes\nthrough me.\u2019 For Mary a \u2018blessed life\u2019 was more about God\nworking in her and through her than having fulfilled dreams,\nfinancial security,  or a good job. The essence of a truly blessed\nlife, is having an increased capacity to carry the life of Jesus into\nour world.</strong></p><p><strong>God\nmay bless you with a prosperous future, or he may not. He may bless\nyou by giving you the desires of your heart, or he may not.

He wants us to get to know who\nJesus really is, so in chapters 3:21-4:13 Luke uses three things to\nreveal Jesus identity.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\u2019\n\t\t\tidentity is revealed through the voice of his Father.

That is quite a lot. They are difficult to\nread, like reading the old phone books we used   to get, and they are\neven more difficult to understand. They feel irrelevant to our lives.\nBut we must remember that they are part of the inspired word of God.\n2 Timothy 3:16-17 says:-</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>All\nScripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,\ncorrecting and training in righteousness, 17 so that the servant of\nGod may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\u2019</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>2.\n</strong><strong>One\nreason family history was important to Israel is that it proved one\u2019s\nidentity as a Jew. It was a legal instrument used to safeguard a\npersons inheritance and property. So a person\u2019s genealogy entitled\nthem to remain on the land God had given to that family/clan and\ntribe through Joshua. The genealogy was a bit like our deeds to our\nhomes or land.</strong></p><p><strong>3.\nT</strong><strong>he\nBible's genealogies were also important in determining who could\nserve in certain roles. These included only Levites working in the\ntabernacle and temple, as well as descendants of Aaron who were to\nserve as high priests. In addition, many activities in the Mosaic Law\nwere limited to those who could prove they were Jewish descendants.</strong><strong>\n They were something like a CV which helped authenticate a persons\ncredibility to serve God in the tabernacle/temple.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank there is nothing random about our existence, we are all part of\na bigger story    </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Job 1:1-5:16</p>",

      "4. It is very significant that Luke\u2019s genealogy of Jesus is one of the most contested portions of scripture, causing many sceptics to raise questions about the authentic identity of Jesus. If you were compare Luke\u2019s genealogy with Matthew\u2019s they are very different. Luke includes many names that Matthew doesn\u2019t. Between Jesus and David, Matthew records 28 generations, as Luke Records 43 because his genealogy is more comprehensive. Matthew left out a number of names because his purpose for recording the genealogy was very different to Luke\u2019s. The problem is that between Jesus and David, Luke's list has very different names to Matthew\u2019s. In Matthew, Joseph\u2019s father is called Jacob, while in Luke he is called Heli. After David is mentioned, the list are the same, then Luke goes past Abraham to Adam.",
      "There have been many attempts over the years to try and reconcile these two genealogies. Some of these theories are very complicated and convoluted. One that is popular amongst evangelical scholars is what is known as the Metoridlineal Theory, which suggests that Luke traces Jesus\u2019 genealogy through his mother Mary and not Joseph his step father. On the surface this sound very plausible, however, there are a number of problems with it. This is a recently new theory, it was first suggested in 1490 by Annius of Viterbo who was an Italian Dominican friar, scholar, and historian. I personally don\u2019t agree with this theory because, Luke was a historian and he was very careful about what he recorded, and he tells us that Heli is the father of Joseph.",
      "One possible solution could be that Matthew traces his line through Joseph\u2019s mother and Luke traces it through his father. So the Jacob of Matthew 1:16 may be Joseph\u2019s grandfather on his mothers side. And the Heli of Luke 3:23 may be Joseph\u2019s actual father. We don\u2019t really know."

We know that his testimony is true. Jesus did\nmany other things as well. if every one of them were written down, I\nsuppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books\nthat would be written.</strong></p><p><strong>John\n21 is one of those chapters that is well known and it is a passage\nthat<br/>\npeople like to speak on, yet in many ways it is a bit of an\nunusual chapter that<br/>\nfeels a bit out of place, like an after\nthought, like a post script. The reason<br/>\nwhy I say that is\nbecause of what it says in the last two verses of chapter 20 we\nread.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NIV reads:-<br/>\nThe Purpose of John\u2019s\nGospel.<br/>\n\u2018\u201930 Jesus performed many other signs in the\npresence of his disciples, which are<br/>\nnot recorded in this book.\nBut these are written that you may believe [This is bettter\nunderstood as \u2018go on believing\u2019,] that Jesus is the Messiah, the\nSon of God and that by believing you may have life in\nhis<br/>\nname.\u2019\u2019<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to be a good ending point\nfor the book, a neat conclusion. Then we<br/>\nread, \u2018\u2019Afterwords\nJesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of<br/>\nGalilee...\u2019\nSo why do we have this post script? this \u2018apparent\u2019 appendix?\nJohn 21 could be viewed as an \u2018encapsulation\u2019 of who Jesus is and\nwhat he came to do. Twice in the chapter John uses the word phaneroo\n\u2018appeared, this term conveys the showing of one\u2019s character,\nmotivations or intentions, and it comes from the verb phain\u014d, which\nmeans \u201cto shine.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as we consider John 21 we need to\nkeep in mind that Jesus\u2019 actions and<br/>\nwords were intended to\ngive His disciples a fuller and deeper revelation of who<br/>\nhe is.\nYou could also say that this chapter not only gives a revelation of\nJesus,<br/>\nbut it also gives us a micro synopsis of John\u2019s gospel,\nand a fitting summation of<br/>\nall the gospels. For in this chapter\nwe have a demonstration of resurrection life<br/>\nand power. This may\nseem a bit surprising, but when I think of living in resurrection\npower I am inclined to think terms of the spectacular, the\nimpressive, the powerful. But as you read John 21 it feels very\nordinary. Okay, there was the great catch of fish, but everything\nelse feels very down to earth. Men out fishing, catching nothing,\nfrustration, failure, disappointment, a barbecue on the beach,\ndifficult conversations. No fireworks or awesome displays of power.\nBut there was the gentle healing power of grace, which is what\nresurrection power is all about.<br/>\n</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you for the gentle power of the resurrection.<br/>\n</strong><em><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan Job 29:14-32:10</strong></em></p>",

That is the question </strong></p><p><strong>The\nchapter begins with these words. </strong><strong>\u2018\u2019Afterwards\nJesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Galilee. It\nhappened this way. Simon Peter, Thomas also known as Didymus,\nNathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other\ndisciples were together. \u201cI\u2019m going out to fish,\u201d Simon Peter\ntold them, and they said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go with you.\u201d So they went out\nand got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.\u2019<br/>\nThere\nhas been a lot of debate about whether Peter was being obedient\nor<br/>\ndisobedient when he went fishing. There are a lot of\narguments that can be<br/>\nmade either way. However, I think that the\nquestion about Peter\u2019s obedience in<br/>\nthis context is the wrong\nquestion to ask. I am not saying that obedience is not<br/>\nan\nimportant issue. However, there are times when we can over simplify\nthings<br/>\nand just have two categories were everything falls,\nobedience or disobedience. As we shall see Peters problem was much\ndeeper and more profound than obedience or disobedience.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\nPeter was motivated by a sense of shame.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bible does\nnot tell us what Peter is thinking or feeling, but we can be certain\nthat he was in a very vulnerable condition. He was in danger of being\nredefined by his failure. He had betrayed Jesus three times with\noaths and curses. He had boasted that although everyone else would\nforsake Jesus he would never. How could he ever get back from this?\nHe is now motivated by shame, he hast lost all his confidence, so he\nretreats to where he feels safe and in control, to a place he knows\nwell, a comfort zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter fishes for answers. </strong></p><p><strong>What\nhave I done? What were those three years about? Who was Jesus? Where\nis he? Who am I? What will I do now? Where will I go? What will\nhappen to me? Peter is searching for meaning, a way forward, a place\nin life. He goes fishing hoping to ease his pain, trying to get\nbeyond his guilt, possibly believing that all his hope and desires to\nfollow Jesus were gone. He found it easier to go fishing than deal\nwith the consequences and the emotional turmoil of his failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe\nall know what it is to fail, we all know what it feels like when we\nwant to disappear, to become unseen. When we are struggling with\npersonal failure, there is something comforting being out in the\nmiddle of the sea in the black of night where we are unnoticed. Our\nshame and guilt create in us a strong desire for isolation. We are\noften driven by intense sense of shame, and we wrongly conclude that\nwe are worthless of acceptance and love. It is in this dark place we\nneed to encounter the risen Lord, and yet, if we are honest, this is\nthe last place we want to encounter him. I love the fact that Jesus\ncame to Peter where he was. Peter was not in prayer meeting, or at a\nspecial retreat. No he was in the mess and confusion of his everyday\nlife. Jesus met him in the last place you would not really expect\nJesus to be. Our everyday lives need to be touched and influenced by\nJesus and his resurrection grace. We need to be open to the process\nof restoration, so we will not be defined by our failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter\nexperienced the mercy of an empty net.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe read in verse 5\n\u2018He called out to them, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cFriends,\nhaven\u2019t you any fish?\u201d</strong></span><strong>\n\u201cNo,\u201dThey answered.\u2019 A better reading of this verse would be,\n\u2018He called out, you haven\u2019t caught any fish have you?\u2019 This is\nmore of a statement than a question. It is as if it had been planned\nor ordained that Simon Peter and the other disciples would catch no\nfish. In the frustration and disappointment of an empty net Peter\nlearned that he had not the ability to fix what was going on in his\nheart, and fish in a net was not going to change anything. Sometimes\nwe think, \u2018if only,\u2026.\u2019 believing that if the \u2018if only,\u2019\nblank was filled in, we would feel better about ourselves. We often\ntry to medicate our pain with stuff when want we really need is\nrenewal in our relationship with Jesus. </strong></p><p><strong>Peter\nneeded to learn that his eagerness to please Jesus would not\nremove<br/>\n<br/>\nthe need to have a difficult conversation. As you\nread this passage you get the impression that Peter wanted to please\nJesus in an attempt to replace the pain he had caused. Listen to\nthese words. \u2018Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \u201cIt\nis the Lord!\u201d As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, \u201cIt is the\nLord,\u201d he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it\noff) and jumped into the water\u2026.. So Simon Peter climbed back into\nthe boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large\nfish.\u2019<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at what Peter did.<br/>\nAs soon as he heard,\nhe wrapped his outer garment around himself, he jumped into the\nwater,  He climb back into the boat He dragged the net ashore He made\nevery effort to please the Lord. I am sure the Lord appreciated his\neagerness, however, eagerness and the desire to please would not go\nfar enough to deal with the real pain  of his heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen\nwe fail and feel compromised it is very easy to think \u2018if I try\nharder, or if I do better then I won\u2019t fall into the same trap, or\nmake the same mistakes.\u2019<br/>\n<br/>\nEnthusiasm is important but it\nwill not address the reasons why we failed in the first place.\nPeter\u2019s enthusiasm was an honest expression of his desire to please\nJesus, but there was a need to go beyond enthusiasm to healing and\nwholeness. And sometimes that can be a process. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeter\nneeded to learn that acceptance proceeds restoration.<br/>\n</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Look\nat what verse 10 says. \u2018\u2019And then Jesus says to them, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Bring\nsome of the<br/>\nfish you have just caught.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nJesus is asking His disciples for something. Can you<br/>\nimagine\nwhat that must have communicated to these disciples? Perhaps\nthe<br/>\ndisciples think that they have nothing Jesus needs; they\nhave nothing to offer<br/>\nJesus whatsoever, he doesn\u2019t need them.\nBut Jesus says, \u2018No, I want to eat<br/>\nyour fish. I value what you\nhave caught. I value what you have to bring to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe\nsecond thing Jesus does to show how he accepted Peter and the rest of\nthe<br/>\ndisciples was he said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Come\nand have breakfast.</strong></span></p><p><strong>Being\ninvited to a meal at the time of Jesus signified deep friendship,\nintimacy and unity. So before Jesus chose to have a difficult\nconversation with Peter, Jesus did everything he could to help Peter\nfeel accepted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is very interesting because we\nusually work the other way round. We think<br/>\nin terms of \u2018Sort\nyourself out then we will accept you,\u2019 but we need to understand\nthat people change because they are loved. It is only in the context\nof accepting love that significant life-changing confrontation and\nconversation can take place.<br/>\n<br/>\nJesus needed to have a\ndifficult conversation with Peter.\u2018\u2019When they had finished\neating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cSimon\nson of John, do you love me more than these?\u201d </strong></span><strong>\u201cYes,\nLord,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cFeed\nmy lambs.\u201d</strong></span><strong>1\nAgain Jesus said, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cSimon\nson of John, do you love me?\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nHe answered, \u201cYes, Lord, you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said,\n</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cTake\ncare of my sheep.</strong></span><strong>\nThe third time he said to him, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cSimon\nson of John, do you love me?\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nPeter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cDo\nyou love me?\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nHe said, \u201cLord, you know all things; you know that I love you.\u201d\nJesus said, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cFeed\nmy sheep.\u201d</strong></span><strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThis\nwas a very difficult conversation for Peter, we are told that he was\nhurt. The word John uses carries the idea of heaviness or distress.\nSometime Jesus needs to come to us and ask us uncomfortable\nquestions, questions that are critically important and life defining.\n<br/>\nConsider what Christ doesn\u2019t do. He doesn\u2019t try to make\nPeter feel guilty. He doesn\u2019t humiliate him publicly. He doesn\u2019t\nask him, \u201cAre you sorry for what you did?\u201d He doesn\u2019t make him\npromise to do better. He just asks one question: </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that you restore us, and for the way you restore us. </strong><em><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan Job 32:11-35:16</strong></em></p>",

      "Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciple by the Sea of Galilee. It happened this way: Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together \u201cI\u2019m going out to fish,\u201d Simon Peter told them, and they said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go with you.\u201d So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing. Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. He called out to them \u201cFriends, haven\u2019t you any fish?\u201d \u201c No,\u201d they answered. He said, \u201cThrow your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.\u201d When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \u201cIt is the Lord!\u201d As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, \u201cIt is the Lord,\u201d he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread. Jesus said to them, \u201cBring some of the fish you have just caught.\u201d So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn Jesus said to them, \u201cCome and have breakfast.\u201d None of the disciples dared ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead."

    "html": "<p><strong>Anna\ngrew.</strong></p><p><strong>Luke\ntells us that she was advanced in years. Her age has been an issue of\nsome debate. She evidently became a widow after only seven years of\nmarriage. The next phrase means either that she lived to the age of\n84 or that she had been a widow for 84 years. If the latter is true,\nhaving probably gotten married at the age of 14, she would now be\n105. In either case, she\u2019s old! The amazing thing about Anna,\ndespite a lifetime of pain and loss, she demonstrated a robust and\ntangible love for God. She was widowed as a young women. In this\nculture widowhood was to guarantee poverty.  This was why in the days\nof the early church, Paul urged YOUNG widows to remarry so the church\nwas not overly burdened with their support. (1st Timothy 5:14.)</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to make an important distinction, there is a vast difference\nbetween growing old and growing up. All who grow old do not grow up.\nSome people grow old and become cantankerous and selfish. They allow\nthe pain of the past to become defining. Anna\u2019s pain was real and\nprofound but it did not make her bitter or angry.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nthe natural sequence of events, growing old should be twinned with\ngrowing spiritually, the older we become, our need and desire for God\nshould grow. I have been struck recently by Daniel, as an old man he\nprayed three times a day. Old age can be very difficult, our bodies\nslow down, we have a lot more limitations, we suffer aches and pains\nand we are unable to do what we once could. In the light of all that\nit can become a bit depressing. However, there may be a more positive\nway to view growing old. We need to become excited about the\nspiritual opportunities that old age can bring. In our later years we\nhave more time and often less responsibility. Think about that, more\ntime for spiritual disciplines, more time to pray, more time to read\nGod\u2019s word, more time to think about, and talk about spiritual\nthings. More time to share your faith with others, more time to\nregain the spiritual ground we may have lost to our past. We should\ntry see the free time that comes with old age as an opportunity to\nrescue our devotional lives from the minimalistic habits that may\nhave shaped them in the past. </strong></p><p><strong>This\nmay sound a bit idealistic, and it is, it may even sound unrealistic,\nand it is, if we have no strong desire for God. In the story of Anna,\nLuke needed to use spiritual verbs to describe and explain Anna\u2019s\nlife. \u2018Serving, worshipping, fasting, praying.\u2019 Imagine living a\nlife that could be only explained by spiritual language. It seems\nthat Anna had a life-long hunger for God. Would that not be amazing?\nDay after day hungering for God. Week after week hungering for God.\nMonth after month hungering for God. Year after year, after year\nhungering for God. Decade after decade after decade after decade,\nhungering for God. Being possessed by a holy discontentment that\nwould reshape our lives. This is something we should all pray for,\nand life-long hunger for God.</strong></p><p><strong>Anna\ndid not allow those around her to determine her spirituality.</strong></p><p><strong>Did\nAnna live and sleep in the Temple?  There were living quarters\n</strong><em><strong>surrounding\n</strong></em><strong>the\nTemple precincts, however, no one was permitted to sleep within the\nTemple itself, nor were women allowed to stay there at night. Luke\u2019s\npoint is simply that she was there at every available hour.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nis something we need to remember, at this time in the history of\nIsrael the temple for the most part was descending into corruption.\nHerod had great influence in the life and running of the temple. He\nappointed the high priest, which was a political appointment. It\nbecame a place marked with greed and the abuse of power for example.\nBecause Jewish law required a temple tax of a half-shekel (</strong><a href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%2030.11%E2%80%9316\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Exodus\n30:11\u201316</strong></a><strong>),\nJews and visitors from other nations came to pay their taxes when\nthey offered their sacrifices. However, foreign coins with the image\nof pagan emperors would not be accepted in God\u2019s temple, so money\nchangers exchanged those foreign coins for Jewish money, but they did\nso at an exorbitant profit. Rather than provide this service as a\nbusiness in another part of town, they exploited the religious zeal\nof the visitors to Jerusalem and did their business on temple\ngrounds. Because they determined their own exchange rate, money\nchangers easily took advantage of the poor and the foreigners pouring\ninto Jerusalem for Passover.  When they brought their animals for the\nsacrifice it was deemed  \u201cunapproved\u201d so this forced the\nworshipper to buy another animal\u2014at an inflated price\u2014from the\ntemple vendors. Such goings-on, exploiting the poor and the\nforeigner, angered the Lord Jesus and was strictly forbidden in the\nMosaic Law (</strong><a href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%2022.21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Exodus\n22:21</strong></a><strong>;\n</strong><a href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Lev%2019.34\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Leviticus\n19:34</strong></a><strong>).</strong></p><p><strong>Further\nmore Anna was at a huge disadvantage because of her gender. </strong><strong>While\nJewish women enjoyed more respect in that day than women in other\ncultures, there still was a fair amount of discrimination against\nthem. The rabbis did not approve of the same amount of instruction in\nthe Torah being given to girls as to boys. They regarded women's\nminds as not adapted for such investigations (Alfred Edersheim,\nSketches of Jewish Social Life [Eerdmans], pp. 132\u2013133). The women\nwere restricted to an area of the temple called \u201cThe Women\u2019s\nCourt.\u201d They could not enter the inner court where the ceremonies\nwere performed.  The segregation of women into a separate place was\nnever mentioned or found in the Old Testament </strong></p><p><strong>It\nwas into this environment that Anna chose to live for God. She did\nnot allow her circumstances or others to dumb down her spirituality.\nShe would have received little if any encouragement from the\nreligious authorities, but she decided to march to the beat of a\ndifferent drum. She decided to walk the road less travelled. She\ndecided not to go with the crowd or follow the herd. She knew the\npotential of living for God and recognised that the loneliness of\nauthentic absloute faithfulness was a price worth paying.   </strong></p><p><strong>Can\nI just say that Anna was a very courageous women. It would have been\nvery easy for her to acquiesce to formulaic religion, where she could\nhave ticked all the right boxes, she could have gone through the\nmotions, but she would never have encountered Jesus. Her courage kept\nher from the spiritual mediocrity of her peers. </strong></p><p><strong>Anna\nhad the ability to understand who Jesus was.</strong></p><p><strong>Luke\ntells us, \u2018</strong><strong>Coming\nup to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke\nabout the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of\nJerusalem.\u2019</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>This\nis amazing, Anna did not have some great vision, or a visit from an\nangel like Zechariah. No, she was just going about her every day\nordinary pursuit of God when she encountered the awesome\nvulnerability of God in a child. </strong></p><p><strong>One\ncommentator writes </strong></p><p><strong>\u2018<strong>Anna\n</strong></strong><strong>possessed\ndivine insight into things normally hidden from ordinary people, and\nhence was able to recognise who the child in the temple was and then\nto proclaim his significance to those who were interested\u2019.\u2019 (G.\nFriedrich, TDNT VI, 836). </strong></p><p><strong>Did\nother people see Jesus that day? </strong></p><p><strong>Yes\nand no. Most saw a poor young couple with a baby, making the required\nsacrifice for dedication. Two saw Jesus, the revelation of God, in\nthe context of the familiarity of their every day lives. </strong></p><p><strong>Could\nit be that in the familiarity of our lives is the best and the most\nimportant place to encounter Jesus?  I think on that day in the\ntemple that day there were two very vulnerable people, God incarnate\nin the small weak body of baby Jesus, and an old widow called Anna.\nOn that day they touched each other lives.  On that day Anna knew\nthat the choices and sacrifices she had made were all worth it. On\nthat day Anna learned that the purpose and ultimate goal for this\nlife was Jesus. Anna loved God with all her heart for all her life.\nOh that we would be the same!

      "Mark 15:21. A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. The record for most extras in a film is in the 1982 classic Gandhi, which used over 300,000 extras for the funeral scene. About 200,000 were volunteers and 94,560 were paid a small fee (under contract). The sequence was filmed on 31st Jan 1981, the 33rd anniversary of Mohand as K. Gandhi's funeral. 11 crews shot over 20,000 feet of film, which was pared down to 125 seconds in the final release. In the massive drama of the passion of the cross it could be very easy to miss the role played by others who could be perceived as \u2018extras,\u2019 seen as those who have blended into the background, with very little significance to the plot line,",
      "Simon of Cyrene could be viewed in this way. We know that he was the man who helped Jesus carry his cross. He is known and unknown. He is there but rarely seen. Why would three of the gospels mention him? Matthew 27:32, Mark 15:21 and Luke 23:26;. He was from Cyrene, modern day Libya, about 900 miles from Jerusalem. Cyrene had a large Jewish population, it may be that Simon had travelled to Jerusalem for the passover. Two other things to mention. He had two sons Alexander and Rufus who were known to the early church, see Romans 16:13. And Luke tells us that Simon was going into the city as Jesus was about to leave it, and it then he was forced to carry the cross of Jesus. Although Simon never says a word in scripture this incident in his life has a lot to say to us. Simon was someone who shared in the Suffering of Jesus, he was the only person who helped Jesus on this terrible day. To share in Christ\u2019s sufferings was one of the Apostle Paul\u2019s aspirations when he said \u2019I want to know Christ\u2014yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death. \u2019To participate in the suffering of Jesus is \u2018fellowship of the heart,\u2019 it is the deepest kind of relationship anyone can have with Jesus, it is the sharing the feeling of sorrow that happens when we choose to share his cross. At the place of suffering there is also the simultaneous call to intimacy. So what does it mean to share in his suffering? We need to accept the unexpected burdens that are forced upon us. In those days a Roman solider had the right commandeer any civilian to carry a burden like their kit, or the patibulum the cross-bar of the cross that usually weighed between thirty or forty pounds and was usually strapped across the shoulders. No Roman soldier would disgrace himself by carrying a cross for a criminal, so they forced Simon to carry the cross. This was not something that Simon was expecting, or anticipated, he was a passing by when he was forced into the drama of the cross. Often in life unexpected burdens come our way, burden that draw us into dramas that we don\u2019t fully understand. We find ourselves in circumstances that are beyond our control, our freedom is taken from us, our plans are lying in ruins. we could feel a bit like Simon, embracing something that feels cruel and reeking of death. Maybe this is the only way we have of sharing in the fellowship of Jesus\u2019 suffering. We will never have to re-enact what Simon did on \u2018good Friday, but at some points in our lives the burdens that are enforced upon us will cause us to decide if we are really prepared to endure the burden, and pay the price of following Jesus to the extent that we can have fellowship in his suffering. Like Simon we have no control or say what burden we may have to carry, however, we can choose to allow those burdens to direct us in the way of Jesus. The unexpected crisis, burdens and interruptions that disrupt our lives could be the things that make Jesus more real. They could be the means where by we can follow Jesus on a path we would never choose for ourselves."

Sometimes, when we begin to share in the sufferings of\nJesus, our plans get thwarted, even good spiritual plans that we have\nearnestly made. I find this very challenging. Something in me would\nrather go to the temple with the masses, and have an easy  \u2018religion\u2019\nthan carry a cross, I find it easier to hold onto my old religious\nways than carry a defining cross behind Jesus and be viewed as an\nobject of disdain and criminalised by my association with him. To\ncarry the cross of Jesus would not had been seen as a badge honour\nbut a symbol of profound shame. There was no visible glory in this\nact of sharing in Jesus\u2019 suffering, but there was a profound\nidentifying with him that is only possible in suffering. </strong></p><p><strong>One\nfinal thought. The way of the cross is not for \u2018super-hero\u2019s.\u2019\nJesus\u2019 body had been robbed of its strength because of a long night\nof interrogation and brutal torture. As God he could have adorned the\n\u2018cape of divinity,\u2019 As the God man he could had made the journey\nto Galgotha in his own strength. But instead he chose in humility, to\nembrace his humanity and all its weakness and pain. He allowed\nhimself to need the help of another. This is still the way of the\ncross. We either can be a Simon or we need a Simon. To share in the\nsufferings of Jesus means that you become more than a passer-by. Have\nyou ever thought about the character of a passer by. A passer by is\nsomeone who makes little if any difference, they are people who take\nno concern or responsibility for those they are passing. Sadly it is\ntoo easy for anyone of us to live our lives as those who simply pass\nby. We keep our distance, we don\u2019t get involved, we are focused on\nour own journey. However, when we begin to share in the suffering of\nJesus, we loose our status as those who simply pass by. We become\nthose who will accept the cross so we can follow Jesus. </strong></p><p><strong>One\nof the greatest tragedies for any Christian is not having a cross to\ncarry, or not knowing how to carry it, thus, becoming someone who\njust passes by. To share in the suffering means that we become a part\nof the greatest and most essential work in the history of the world.\nThis is the opposite to just passing by. The will of God is\naccomplished through those who have their present interrupted by the\ncross, and the future defined by the cross. Those who humbly accept\nthe shameful, humiliating position of accepting the cross are those\nwho are able to carry out God\u2019s purposes because their lives is no\nlonger about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nwe have been given circumstances and\nburdens that we haven\u2019t chosen for ourselves. Like Simon, our hopes\nand plans have been destroyed. However these days may give us a\nunique opportunity to follow Jesus in ways that we haven\u2019t done\nbefore and to share in His suffering so that we can experience the\ndepth of fellowship with Him we all long for. As God\u2019s story\nunfolds in these days, let us not become like those who just pass by\nbut let us become people who are used by God to show his story to the\nworld. </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nI confess it is so easy to embrace the status of a \u2018passer by\u2019\nwho does not get involved.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Psalms 9-10</p>",

      "There is a possibility that Simon may had been a Jewish pilgrim who had travelled from Cyrene to celebrate the passover. If this is the case, he was a man on a spiritual journey who desired to meet with God. He may have been looking forward to coming to the temple, possibly for the first time to make sacrifices in the temple. This may have been something he had looked forward to for a long time; but there was a problem. When he began to carry the cross of Jesus he would have been designated as being unclean, preventing him from going to the temple, from making sacrifices and excluded from the passover celebrations. As the cross was placed on his back he was no longer able to partake in his religious /customs and practices of the passover. He was separated from the ritualistic worship of his fore fathers through the cross of Jesus."

However, if we are going to build,\nsustain and grow healthy relationships that honestly reflect\nauthentic submission and love for God then we will need to learn how\nto forgive. In the sermon on the mount Jesus addresses the issue of\nforgiveness.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nwant to look at what Jesus said about forgiveness in this context,\nthen try and apply what it means to our lives.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to acknowledge that forgiveness is a very emotive and difficult\nsubject. Many of us have been greatly hurt, we carry wounds that may\nnever heal, many have known the pain of rejection, the pain of\nbetrayal, and the thought of expressing forgiveness to that person\nfeels traumatic, if not impossible.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to get a clear understanding as to what forgiveness is and what\nit isn\u2019t. </strong></p><p><strong>Often\nwe have a very confused or distorted understanding when it comes to\nforgiving others, which makes the act of forgiving more difficult. </strong></p><p><strong>Forgiveness\nis not belittling the pain you have suffered. It does not mean that\nthe pain of betrayal will disappear. It does not mean that the pain\nyou have suffered does not matter. In fact the act of forgiving helps\nmanage and control the hurt, preventing it from developing into\nbitterness.</strong></p><p><strong>Forgiveness\nis not condoning someone's evil behaviour towards you. Forgiving is\nnot saying, the evil act you did to me does not matter, it does\nmatter, and because it matters I need to engage in the process of\nforgiving. </strong></p><p><strong>Forgiveness\nis not absolving someone of the consequences of their bad behaviour.\nForgiveness will not eradicate the consequences that are the result\nof your sin against someone. </strong></p><p><strong>Forgiveness\nis not forgetting. Many in the church teach the false practice of\n\u2018forgive and forget.\u2019 when in reality to \u2018forgive and forget\u2019\nmakes authentic forgiveness impossible because it is a refusal to\ndeal with the real issues. God has made us in such a way that it is\nPsychologically impossible to totally eradicate all memory of hurt\ndone to us in the past. People would often say that God forgets our\nsins, that is not true, God chooses not to remember them, see\nJeremiah 31:34. </strong></p><p><strong>Not\nforgetting does not mean that we obsessively continually recall every\ndetail,  rather we acknowledge the hurt of the past in such a way\nthat it can\u2019t define who we are and who we are becoming.</strong></p><p><strong>Forgiveness\ndoes not mean that you should not maintain protective boundaries to\nprevent further hurt or abuse.         </strong></p><p><strong>In\nour passage Jesus makes six direct references to forgiveness.

      "If we were to sit down and read through the Sermon on the Mount you would discover one main theme, one major note, which is relationship. The sermon is describing those who live under the authority and rule of the Kingdom of God. How that rule is manifested and seen in our lives, is through how we relate to others. It is as if Jesus is saying that the only authentic indication that you are living for me is through your relationships; not your ministry, not you work for God, but the quality of your relationships."

They are a\ncommentary on verse 12 which reads, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>And\nforgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.</strong></span><strong>\n So what is Jesus saying?</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nThose who are forgiven will forgive.</strong></p><p><strong>As\nwe have already said, forgiving others can be very difficult, painful\nand demanding, especially if we have been severely hurt or\ntraumatised by them. Forgiveness can feel like a step too far. Yet we\nare confronted by these words of Jesus.  </strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to look at who Jesus is talking to here. He </strong><strong>is\nnot talking to those who are needing initial, first time forgiveness\nfor entry into relationship with God.  These people were already\nclearly believers in Jesus' mind. These are people that possess the\nkingdom of heaven (5:3, 10), who hunger and thirst after\nrighteousness (6), who are called the </strong><em><strong>sons</strong></em><em><strong>\n</strong></em><strong>of\nGod (9), who are the salt of the earth (13) and the light of the\nworld (14) and who have God as their personal Father in a relational\nway.</strong></p><p><strong>These\nare people who have experienced and enjoyed the enriching freeing\npower of the grace of God; they are people who have learned that they\ncan be redefined by forgiveness. They are people who have had their\nshame removed. So for them not to show forgiveness is to belittle\nwhat God has done in their lives and deny who they have become in\nJesus. </strong></p><p><strong>As\nChristians, God expects us to be the most forgiving people.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nthe New Testament, the word forgiveness was used primarily to\ndescribe the release of someone from a financial obligation.\nForgiveness gives up the right to hurt back. When you forgive\nsomeone, you are saying, \u201cWhat that person did to me was wrong. He\nhas hurt me deeply and deserves to pay for his offence. But today I\nam releasing him of the obligation he has toward me. I am not\nforgiving him because he has asked to be forgiven or deserves to be\nforgiven. I am forgiving him because of the tremendous forgiveness\nGod has offered me. Asking for God\u2019s forgiveness for one\u2019s own\nsins, all the while withholding forgiveness from someone else, is not\nonly bizarre but hypocritical.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nforgive because our relationships are important to our Father.</strong></p><p><strong>One\nof the things God will hold us accountable for is the nature and\nquality of our relationships. Imagine two children sitting in the\nback arguing, and mum and dad are in the front of the car, overjoyed,\nthrilled and delighted that the children are arguing and fighting. \nOf course, that would never happen. When I have an unforgiving heart\ntowards others, I am internalising my conflict with them.  We can\nweaponise our emotions, and begin to harbour feelings of resentment\nand bitterness. Sadly the church has created a consumer approach to\nrelationships. I get involved with others if they meet my needs, and\nif they hurt me then I am free to walk away, my relationship with\nthem is like a \u2018soiled nappy,\u2019 disposable. I don\u2019t have to work\nthrough the issues and the struggles of forgiving.     </strong></p><p><strong>We\nare never more like God than when we forgive.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nglories of the character of God is most clearly seen when we have a\nheart of forgiveness. The life of Jesus is best displayed through our\nlove and forgiveness of others.  When we forgive another person, we\ndiscover that we are participating in a supernatural event. God not\nonly gives the command to forgive, but the power to forgive.\nConversely, when we abstain from the difficult process of forgiving\nand choose not to forgive, then we are never less like God.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay the attitudes of my heart echo your heart. </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Psalms 17:6-18:36</p>",

What do I mean. We all know and love the\nstory of the \u2018prodigal son.\u2019 while telling this story Jesus said\nthese words, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018\u201cBut\nwhile he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled\nwith compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him\nand kissed him.\u2019 </strong></span><strong>The\nson was </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018still\na long way off, and his father saw him and filled with compassion he\nran.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nThe father had developed a heart that longed to forgive his son, he\nlonged for the opportunity to show mercy. Maybe he sat on his porch,\nscanning the horizon, looking and longing, ready to run at the least\nglimmer of repentance?</strong></p><p><strong>In\nsome ways the question of the offending persons repentance is\nirrelevant, for this reason, the repentance of the \u2018offender,\nalthough essential, will not increase my ability to forgive. It may\nincrease my opportunity to forgive, but not my ability to forgive. If\nI am not living with the hope and expectation of forgiving the person\nwho has hurt me before they repent, I am unlikely to feel different\nif they repent.    </strong></p><p><strong>We\nforgive because we refuse to define the person who has hurt us by the\nharm they have done to us.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nare two pitfalls we need to avoid that will hinder us in our desire\nand ability to forgive. We can cause the hurt caused to us to become\ndefining. So we develop a victim mindset. Sometimes, the pain is so\ndeep, and the circumstances in which we were hurt were so dark that\nit is a huge battle not to live as a victim.</strong></p><p><strong>On\nthe other hand, if we have been deeply hurt by someone, it is very\ndifficult to see past what they have done, and their offence against\nus becomes the only way we choose to identify them. When God forgives\nus he is choosing not to allow our sin to become means by which he\nidentifies us. Does that mean he ignores or belittles our sin? Of\ncourse not.  As sinful people we are more than just sinful people.\nAnd as forgiven people we have an opportunity to see people as more\nthan those who have hurt us.</strong></p><p><strong>One\nfinal question:- What does it mean when Jesus said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018B</strong></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>ut\nif you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your\nfather forgive you.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n What is he saying? We know from other scriptures that nothing will\nseparate us from the love of God, we also know that salvation is a\ngift from God, it is something you cannot earn or deserve.. so how\nare we to understand these words? I think what Jesus may be saying\nhere is, \u2018If we choose not to forgive, God will hand us over to the\nconsequences and the fruit of our unforgiving attitude.\u2019  </strong></p><p><strong>An\nunforgiving attitude will produce a rotten, bitter harvest in our\nlives, not in the lives of others. It will diminish us into small\ngraceless people who will use their energy to carry and maintain\ntheir resentment and bitterness. </strong></p><p><strong>When\nGod hands us over to the consequences of being unforgiving, what\nhappens?   </strong></p><p><strong>Could\nI suggest the following? </strong></p><p><strong>1.\nOur fellowship with the Father is blocked.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The Holy\nSpirit is grieved.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Our prayers will not be\nanswered.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. God leaves us alone to face the problems of\nlife in our own power.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. The devil gains a foothold\nthrough our bitterness.</strong></p><p><strong>6.\nWe waste time nursing a wounded spirit.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. We become\nenslaved to the people we hate.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. We become like the\npeople we refuse to forgive.</strong></p><p><strong>9.\nWe can develop physical and psychological problems.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Although\nthe bible is insistent that we live as forgiving people, it never\ndown plays how difficult and costly forgiving others can be. No one\nknows this truth more than God. The price and pain he paid to forgive\nus cannot be measured.  </strong><strong>When\nGod the Father allowed his dear son to be murdered at the cross, one\nof the things we learn is that although the price of forgiveness is\nhigh, Love chooses to pay it.      </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay </strong><strong>I\nhave \u2018a sitting on the porch\u2019 attitude scanning for an\nopportunity to forgive. </strong><em><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan Psalms 18:37-21:13</strong></em></p>",

      "The passage we are looking is a very well known passage, it is a passage that is often used as an evangelistic or an apologetic text that shows people that Jesus is the only way to the Father. Although it may be legitimate to use the text in the way, I don\u2019t think that this was its intended purpose. Jesus is speaking to those who have made a commitment to follow him. He is speaking to people who\u2019s world is about to fall apart. This is a pastoral passage, where Jesus wants to equip those who love him with the resources to cope with the inevitability of trouble, uncertainty, confusion and fear. Part of the problem with this passage, in my view is that it has been \u2018over heaven-ised.\u2019 by that I mean that most people assume that Jesus is referring to heaven in this passage and his purpose is to generate hope in the hearts of his disciples. I am sure there is an element of truth in this kind of application, but I don\u2019t think this was Jesus\u2019 intention. Nor do I think the disciples would have thought about heaven when they heard these words.",

So when Jesus\nspeaks about being the way to the father he is speaking more about\nbeing transformational process of becoming more like children of God\nthan about a geographical location.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\ngoing to his father will make the work he has called us to possible. </strong></p><p><strong>John\n14:12 </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018</strong></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>Very\ntruly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have\nbeen doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because\nI am going to the Father.\u2019</strong></span></p><p><strong>This\nis one of those verses that has caused a lot of debate and confusion.\nWe need to keep these words in their context. Jesus is still speaking\nas a \u2018groom\u2019 who is about to return to his Father. Because he is\nreturning to his father by defeating Satan, sin and death, the works\nthat we will do will reflect his glorious victory. Some Christians\nteach that Jesus is saying that we will do greater miracles than him.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nis unlikely for a number of reasons:-</strong></p><p><strong>a.\nWhen Jesus said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>I\ntell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing,\nand they will do even greater things than these.\u2019 </strong></span><strong>Whoever\nbelieves includes all believers.

So everyone cannot do miracles, but all can do the \u2018greater\nworks.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>b.\nIn John\u2019s gospel the word that he uses for miracles is signs, not\nwork or things.</strong></p><p><strong>c.\nI doubt if anyone could do the miracles Jesus did.</strong></p><p><strong>I\nthink the point is this. The greater works are the glories of the\nfather being clearly displayed through his family because of Jesus\u2019\nvictory.</strong></p><p><strong>5.\nJesus going to the father redefines prayer.</strong></p><p><strong>Look\nat these amazing verses.

When Jesus speaks\nabout a new commandment, he is giving the old commandment a new\ndepth, a new intensity, a new dimension. He is saying \u2018love each\nother, but it must be in the same way that I have loved you.\u2019   </strong></p><p><strong>2.\nWhat does it mean to love people in the way Jesus loves us?</strong></p><p><strong>a.\nIt is not complicated.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nchapter 13 of John, Jesus shows us what he is thinking about when he\ntalks about </strong></p><p><strong>loving\nothers the way he loves us. The interesting thing about this chapter\nis that there are no miracles, no awesome displays of power, nothing\nspectacular.  </strong></p><p><strong>It\nwas Jesus responding to an everyday circumstance.

The simple humble act of foot washing\nwas the complete or full expression of Jesus\u2019 love.</strong></p><p><strong>b.\nIt requires security and humility.</strong></p><p><strong>Look\nat how John describes Jesus\u2019 thinking at this time. John 13: \u2018Jesus\nknew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the\nFather.

He lived out of a security that allowed him to\nbe humble. He had come from God and was returning to God. </strong></p><p><strong>At\nits root all pride is an expression of insecurity. Many people go\nthrough life never knowing the glorious joy of having their \u2018feet\nwashed,\u2019 because of their insecurity and pride. There is a very\ninteresting thing we miss in our English versions. When it says in\nverse 4 that Jesus \u2018took off his outer clothes.\u2019 the word used\nfor \u2018took of,\u2019 is \u2018tithemi.

And lots lots more, there are a million ways to wash feet.</strong></p><p><strong>b.\nBe spontaneous. </strong></p><p><strong>Look\nwhat John says </strong><strong>The\nevening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted\nJudas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.</strong><strong>\nso he[Jesus] got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and\nwrapped a towel around his waist.</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>After\nthat, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples\u2019\nfeet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.

But guests were usually expected to wash their own feet.\nWashing the dirt off someone else\u2019s feet was a task reserved for\nonly the lowest ranking Gentile servants, and Jewish slaves were\noften exempted from this duty. In a household without slaves,\neveryone washed his or her own feet. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nwashing the feet of his disciples Jesus was sacrificing his\nreputation. It is okay to loose your reputation for the sake of\nshowing selfless love to others. Sadly many people loose their\nreputation because of selfish sinfulness and in the process they hurt\nothers.</strong></p><p><strong>d.\nThe expression of love is more important than the success of love. As\nyou read through this passage you get the feeling that the disciples\ndidn\u2019t really get what Jesus did.

That has to be okay.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nare two things we need to notice as we conclude.</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nJesus has promised that </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018If\nwe love one another as He has loved us, everyone will know we are His\ndisciples.\u2019</strong></span></p><p><strong>The\nradical ongoing expression of sacrificial foot washing love is the\nonly way we have of getting the attention of the world outside.

We are\ncontinually deconstructing the Jesus of the bible so he will fit\nbetter into our lives. We have got this all wrong, we are the ones\nthat need to change, not him. Being made in the image of God, means\nthat our encounters with Jesus, will show us who we really need to\nbe.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nJohn 6 we meet a lot of people who wanted Jesus, they wanted a\nrelationship with him, but the problem was that they wanted a\nrelationship with him on their terms. They wanted Jesus to become a\n\u2018father Christmas,\u2019 type god. The kind of god who would meet all\ntheir needs, a god who bought into their materialism, a god who was\nconsumer friendly.</strong></p><p><strong>To\nhelp us grasp the life changing message we need to take a brief look\nat its context.</strong></p><p><strong>On\nthe previous day Jesus had miraculously fed a crowd of over 5000\npeople. We are so familiar with this story that we miss its impact.\nMost of these people were poor, and lived on a subsistence diet. In\nMatthew\u2019s account we are told \u2018They all ate and were satisfied.\u2019\nMatthew 14:20. These people knew what it was like to be hungry. The\nword Matthew uses for satisfied was the same word used to describe a\nwell-fed animal. </strong></p><p><strong>By\nJesus\u2019 time, most families in Israel had no land. Most of the land\nwas controlled by a few powerful families and moneylenders. Tax\ncollectors and soldiers would grab most of the crops that were grown\nand most money that was earned. The people were left with very little\nto live on. Most people were hungry most of the time. Many would have\nto find some work each day as a day laborer to buy their food for\nthat day. That is why Jesus knew the people had followed him round\nthe lake to listen to his teaching all day would be hungry. If they\nhad not worked, they would have had no food, and would not have been\nable to buy any.</strong></p><p><strong>For\nthese people, the Roman Empire was a terrible place to live. Land was\nconcentrated in the hands of a few. Capital was no longer distributed\nevenly. The people did not have money to lend to others, because all\nsurpluses were taken by the Romans and the temple system. Life was\nbrutal and extreme poverty was normal. (No wonder people were looking\nfor a Messiah who would break the shackles of Rome and free them from\nthe burden of debt and tax.)</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>It\nis in this context that the crowd went looking for Jesus; as we go\nthrough this passage we are going to notice that Jesus confronts them\nat a very deep and challenging level.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me understand that the context or the circumstances of my life\nwill not excuse wrong attitudes about Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Psalms 40-42</p>",

They wanted to be with Jesus because of what\nhe could do for them, not because they wanted to know and love him.\nIt is like getting married to someone not because you love them, but\nbecause they can do something for you. In the light of passage, we\nneed to conclude that Jesus is interested </strong><strong>in\nour motive for following him.</strong></p><p><strong>Why\ndo you want to follow Jesus?  Why do you want to live for God? Some\nmay think that if you are doing the right thing, and following Jesus\nthen surely motive is not important. Look at these words by A W\nTozer.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>The\ntest by which all conduct must finally be judged is motive. As water\ncannot rise higher than its source, so the moral quality in an act\ncan never be higher than the motive that inspires it. For this\nreason, no act that arises from an evil motive can be good, even\nthough some good may appear to come out of it. Every deed done out of\nanger or spite, for instance, will be found at last to have been done\nfor the enemy and against the Kingdom of God. Unfortunately, the\nnature of religious activity is such that much of it can be carried\non for reasons that are not good, such as anger, jealousy, ambition,\nvanity and avarice. All such activity is essentially evil and will be\ncounted as such at the judgment.\u2019 \ntps://acts2024ministries.wordpress.com/tag/tozer/#:~:text=The%20test%20by%20which%20all,to%20come%20out%20of%20it.</strong></p><p><strong>Motives\nare important because they are all about our hearts, and following\nJesus is all about the heart. Many people give up their Christian\nfaith because their motivation has been about using Jesus not knowing\nand loving Him. When their expectations are not met, they get\nfrustrated and angry and then they walk away.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nredirects their focus. </strong></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\">\u201c</span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>Do\nnot work for food that perishes but for food that lasts for eternal\nlife, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has\nset his seal on him.\u201d </strong></span></p><p><strong>In\nsome ways these words redefine our humanity and go against our\ncultural and social norms.  We live in a world where we are taught\nour significance, identity and security are all tied up in our work.\nWork is a good thing and a gift from God, but the focus of our lives\nmust be primarily on our spiritual lives. </strong></p><p><strong>Do\nyou remember when Jesus was hungry in the wilderness, Satan tempted\nhim to turn stones into bread. Basically, he was saying \u2018Jesus use\nyour power to meet your own needs, it is not God\u2019s will for you to\nbe hungry.\u2019 Jesus\u2019 reply was amazing. He quoted Deuteronomy\n8;3.</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2019Man\ndoes not live on bread alone, but on every word, that comes from the\nmouth of God.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nThis is what Jesus is saying to these people. \u2018you need more than\nbread, you need more than having your material needs met, you need to\ngrasp the fact that your humanity is created for intimacy with God\nand that is what you should be labouring at. </strong></p><p><strong>Our\njobs have a measure of importance and we should do our best at them,\nhowever, if we take them too seriously, and they become essential for\nour identity and significance, then we will not have the heart or\nenergy to labour for the bread that does not spoil.  Remember Jesus\nis speaking to people who had very little, they were poor people, yet\ntheir poverty did not excuse them from having a materialistic\nattitude.  </strong></p><p><strong>This\nprinciple needs to govern our lives.  The quality of the lives we\nlive is not dependent upon the possessions we possess, or the things\nwe achieve, but upon us allowing the word of God to nourish and\ntransform us.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nexpose in me any wrong motive for following you</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Psalms 43:1-45:12</p>",

Jesus is not saying that we are saved by doing\nwork. But what he is saying is that these people must work at having\nfaith. </strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe think of believing we usually have a very narrow or precise\nunderstanding of what faith means. Let me explain, often we think as\nunbelief or doubt as the opposite of belief/faith. And they can be,\nespecially when it comes to our understanding or reasoning. However,\na better word to describe the opposite of the bible\u2019s understanding\nbelief/faith is independence. The Greek word John uses for </strong><strong>belief\n</strong><em><strong>pisteu</strong></em><em><strong>\u014d</strong></em><strong>)\nmeans a lot more than mental assent. The word was used by the Greeks\nto mean \u201cto believe </strong><em><strong>in</strong></em><strong>\nsomething\u201d not just to believe facts about something. It meant to\n</strong><em><strong>trust</strong></em><strong>\nin; to have confidence in.  It </strong><strong>means\nto entrust oneself to an entity in complete confidence. To believe in\nwith the implication of total commitment to the one who is trusted.</strong></p><p><strong>The\ninteresting thing is this, Jesus describes the act or process of\ntotal dependence, i.e. believing as work. Why would he do that? I\nthink most of us are uncomfortable with the thought of being\ndependent, we are happy with a \u2018cerebral,\u2019 faith, a faith that\nacknowledges, but we need a faith that depends.</strong></p><p><strong>To\nbecome people who are living dependent lives is never a default\nposition, it is not something we would choose or want.  We don\u2019t\nlike to look weak, or recognize we are people of need. We need to\ncultivate an attitude of dependence. We need to work hard to become\npeople who live as those who continually feel their need of God.  \n</strong><strong>Very\nearly in Greek history, the word for work was associated with\nspecific occupations like farming or being a soldier. It draws a\npicture of someone actively engaged in production or achievement. We\nneed to become people who are actively engaged in becoming people who\nhave an ever-increasing need of God. Cultivating dependence upon God\nat its essence is one of the ways we express our love for him.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nwork of complete and total surrender of dependence is the best work\nany person can do, the word that describes this work is faith.     </strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme just give one simply illustration of how we resist dependence and\nfight to hold onto our independence. Do you ever find it difficult to\nask for prayer? Sometimes it is the last thing we will do. We don\u2019t\nwant to become vulnerable, we want to protect our reputation of being\nable to cope.  Prayer is a language of dependence.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nwork of faith is not only developing dependence, but it is choosing\nto trust God irrespective of what circumstances we may be struggling\nwith. It is trusting God in the face of uncertainty and confusion.\nSometimes holding on to your faith can be very hard work.   </strong></p><p><strong>There\nis a difference between depending on someone and using someone. These\npeople were looking for Jesus to use him to meet their need for\nbread.  However, when it comes to dependence upon Jesus, it has more\nto do with love and devotion.   Dependence upon Jesus is to\nacknowledge Jesus himself is our greatest need.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me to cultivate real dependence on you.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Psalms 45:13-48:14</p>",

As part of his argument he says,\n\u2018The eye cannot say to hand \u2018I don\u2019t need you!\u2019 And the head\ncannot say to the feet \u2018I don\u2019t need you!\u2019 1Corthians12:21. The\nword that Paul uses for need in this verse carries the idea of\nneeding help. </strong></p><p><strong>Why\ndo you think sometimes we all find it hard to ask for help? We find\nit difficult to recognise that our need of help should be our default\nposition, or factory setting if you like, or creators intention.  God\nhas designed us in such a way that we need each other. Not only are\nwe designed to need and receive help from others, but also the\nprovidences and circumstances that God brings into our lives\nhighlight our need of others and their help, life is too big and too\ntough for us to make it by ourselves.  Needing help from others is\none of the glories of our humanity, for in recognising our need of\nhelp we realise that we were never created to be independent\nself-contained people. Refusal to ask for help is one of the ways sin\ndehumanises</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>I\nwant </strong><strong>to\ntry and unpack this whole subject and try and give us some practical\nsteps we can take to build a community that can embrace life to the\nfull, and grasp the importance of doing life together.   </strong></p><p><strong>We\nwant to begin by looking at \u2018doing life together,\u2019 by considering\nthe importance of being a friend and having a friend.  Many people\nwho attend church often feel out of place, disconnected, isolated.\nMany people who faithfully attend church, they faithfully serve God,\nbut in their hearts there is an ache, a longing to be \u2018known\u2019 to\nbe appreciated and loved.  Every one of us has a God given need for\nintimacy and full acceptance. We are not made for shallow superficial\nrelationships, but for quality friendships that transform and sustain\nus. </strong></p><p><strong>Some\nvery spiritual people would say that all you need is God, that God is\nenough. But that kind of thinking is not biblical. When God saw Adam\nalone in the garden, he did not say to Adam, \u2018Now Adam, you have\nme, I am all you need.\u2019 No, he gave Adam another human being who he\ncould relate to. God knew that Adam bore his image, and in bearing\nthe image of God, Adam needed to have healthy, quality relationships\nso he could be the person he was meant to be.</strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme just say something about loneliness </strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Loneliness\nwas the first thing that God's eye named as not good.\u2019 - John\nMilton</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword lonely means \u2019dejected for want of company,\u2019 I think\nloneliness could be understood as \u2018echo\u2019s of lost-ness,\u2019 </strong></p><p><strong>Listen\nto these words that help us understand loneliness.  \"Darkness is\nsuch that I really do not see\u2014neither with my mind nor with my\nreason\u2014the place of God in my soul is blank\u2014There is no God in\nme\u2014when the pain of longing is so great\u2014I just long &amp; long\nfor God. \u2026 The torture and pain I can't explain.\"A letter of\nmother Teresa from 1961</strong></p><p><strong>Researchers\nrate loneliness as a higher risk to people than lifelong smoking.\nResearchers also link a lack of social interaction with the onset of\ndegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s. One study reported a\ndoubled risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in lonely people compared with\nthose who were not lonely. </strong></p><p><strong>It\nhas been shown that loneliness makes it harder to regulate behaviour,\nrendering people more likely to drink excessively, have unhealthier\ndiets or take less exercise. There is also evidence that loneliness\nadversely affects the immune and cardio-vascular systems.</strong></p><p><strong>Loneliness\nis a taboo subject. It is not a subject we find easy to talk about,\nas people we find it hard to confess that we may be lonely, for in\ndoing so we think we appear to be weak or lacking something.  </strong></p><p><strong>In\norder for us to do life together we will need to understand and\nexperience Jesus\u2019 understanding of friendship. Jesus had a lot to\nsay about friendship, and as we shall see Jesus\u2019 teaching on\nfriendship gives it a new significance and depth, Jesus elevates the\nconcept of friendship to a new height of commitment and love.  You\ncould say that the way Jesus approaches friendship is so radical and\ncounter cultural that it may feel alien to most of us.

We need to\nkeep that in mind, for the context of these words give them a greater\nseriousness. Jesus is preparing his disciples for the future, He is\ngiving them essential instructions so they can live the life he wants\nthem to live. There are a number of lessons we can learn from what\nJesus says in these verses.  </strong></p><p><strong>Relationships\nare more important than programmes.

He simply commands that we love each other. </strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes\nin church life we find it easier to invest in programmes than in\nrelationships.

Are we inclined to operate as if programmes are more\nimportant than relationships?</strong></p><p><strong>Friendship\nis the natural, spontaneous outworking of the love of God in\nsomeone\u2019s life. \u2018Friend\u2019 was the word Jesus used to describe\nthe natural consequences of his love for his disciples what does it\nmean to Love one another as friends? The word the bible often uses\nfor love is AGAPE. What is AGAPE love?</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsource of agape love is not the character of the person who is being\nloved, or even their need, but rather it is about the character and\nnature of the person who is \u2018doing the loving.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>The\nquality of agape love is unconditional, it is not based on merit, and\nit does not need to be deserved.</strong></p><p><strong>The\ngoal of agape love is always the highest good of the other person, no\nmatter the cost.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nevidence of agape love is action. It is not emotion centred but will\ncentred. It is practical, it chooses to act.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nextent of agape love is sacrificial. The true nature of love will\nalways lead to sacrifice. </strong></p><p><strong>To\nbe a friend means that we need to receive God\u2019s love for us.

This is not to suggest that we are to command our friends\nto do certain things.

There is a too high expectation which usually kills\nthe friendship by making us demanding, controlling and selfish. The\nother is having too low or no expectations at all.

For Jesus there was a\nconnection between being open and learning from his Father, and being\nopen with others. In the mind and experience of Jesus these two\nthings are connected, they are linked, they are indissoluble. The\nheart attitudes that we require so we can open ourselves up to God in\norder to hear what he wants to say to us, are the same heart\nattitudes required to open ourselves up to others. Both these things\nrequire vulnerability. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nthings that we learn from the Father will always encourage and\nenhance our friendships. As </strong><strong>we\nlisten to God our capacity to enter into meaningful, God pleasing\nfriendships will increase.</strong></p><p><strong>Friendships\nneed time to develop.

This is not\nan automatic certainty; growth in friendship must be intentional.\nGrowth in friendships will change how we view the other person. Our\nunderstanding and perception of the other person will gradually\nchange.</strong></p><p><strong>Authentic\nfriendship could be understood as a reflection of election. What do I\nmean?

      "Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector ; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: \u201cDo not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: \u2018The kingdom of heaven has come near. \u2019Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. \u201cDo not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts\u2014 no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. As you enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. \u201cI am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you \u201cBrother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another.

It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters.

So don\u2019t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. \u201cWhoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven. \u201cDo not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn \u201c\u2018 a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law\u2014a man\u2019s enemies will be the members of his own household.\u2019 \u201cAnyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. \u201cAnyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet\u2019s reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person\u2019s reward.

But if we are going to really understand the full impact of\nthis passage and how it relates to us having a heart for people, then\nwe will need to take a look at the proceeding passage.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nincident effected Jesus deeply, and he refers to in the next chapter\nMatthew 10:24-25  </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\"A student is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his\nmaster.  It is enough for the student to be like his teacher, and the\nservant like his master.

The word\nBeelzebub is found seven times in the New Testament, and always in\nthe context of the Pharisees misjudging Jesus. On a number of\noccasions they claim that Satan, the prince of demons inspired the\nwork Jesus was doing. What does Beelzebub mean?</strong></p><p><strong>Some\nbelieve that it has an Old Testament origin. King Ahaziah, in an act\nof apostasy, sent to inquire of \"Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron,\"\nin one of the Philistine cities (II Kings 1:2-16). The two parts of\n\"Baal-zebub\" means, \"lord of the fly.\" Baal was\nthe Canaanite god of fertility and fire, one of the chief deities of\nthe area. Zebub means fly or poisonous insect (the same word is used\nof one of the plagues of Egypt, Exodus. 8:20-32). The Philistines may\nhave actually worshiped the fly. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nMark 3:22 (= Matt. 12:24; cf. 9:34; Luke 11:15) the Pharisees\ndisparage Jesus and attempt to explain his power over demons as\nitself of demonic origin by saying, \"He is Beelzebub, the prince\nof the demons.\" The precise meaning of Beelzebub is uncertain.\nYet it certainly is related to the name of the pagan deity associated\nwith the enduring enemy of Israel. It can also mean, Lord of the\nhouse, or higher abode. In the sense that often the pagan temples\nwere often located on high ground. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nthese verses Jesus shares some of the pain of his own heart. To be\ncalled Beelzebub causes Jesus some pain, it made an impact on Him.\nWhy did Jesus think it was important to share this incident? There\nmay be two possible reasons. Firstly, because they were suggesting\nthat Jesus\u2019 ministry had a demonic origin and not a divine one.  It\nwould be like someone in a public position declaring that you were\ndemonized, therefore, who you are, and what you do is both wrong and\ndangerous.  They were not only attacking His ministry, but they were\nattacking who He was so they could undermine His ministry. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nwas not immune to feeling pain, what people said effected him, he did\nnot have some emotional body armor to protect Him, but as He shares\nHis pain, He is teaching his disciples how he coped with these evil\nallegations.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that Jesus understands the pain we feel when other\ncriticize us</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 0 Psalms 68:5-69:4</p>",

      "Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: \u201cDo not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: \u2018The kingdom of heaven has come near. \u2019Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. \u201cDo not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts\u2014 no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. As you enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. \u201cI am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you \u201cBrother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. \u201cThe student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master.

When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on\nthem, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a\nshepherd.  Then he said to his disciples, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"The\nharvest is plentiful but the workers are few.  Ask the Lord of the\nharvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.\"\n </strong></span></p><p><strong>What\nis compassion?</strong></p><p><strong>The\n\tword compassion is found 12 times in the New Testament. Eight times\n\tit refers to Jesus emotional condition.  Of all the words used to\n\tdescribe his emotional life, this was the word used most often.\n\tMatthew 9:36; Matthew 14:14; Matthew 15:32; Matthew 20:34; Mark\n\t1:41; Mark 6:34; Mark 8:2; Luke 7:13;  There is a very important\n\treason why the New Testament uses the word compassion most often to\n\tdescribe the emotional life of Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>Often\nas Christians we put far too much emphasis on what we mistakenly\nrefer to as 'a call'. We had some significant spiritual experience in\nthe past, and we assume that this 'call' has empowered and equipped\nus for ministry.  For Jesus, ongoing experience of compassion was one\nof the indications that His 'call' was from the Father.</strong></p><p><strong>On\nthree occasions, Jesus refers to it in his teaching. In the Parable\nof the Unforgiving servant Matthew 18:27 The Parable of the Good\nSamaritan Luke 10:33, and the Parable of the Prodigal Son Luke 15:20.\n</strong></p><p><strong>It\nwas also used as a cry of a father over his demonised son Mark 9:22.</strong></p><p><strong>Every\n\ttime Jesus was moved with compassion, something significant happened\n\tin the lives of other people.</strong></p><p><strong>When\n\tJesus was moved with compassion other people saw it. Compassion is\n\tnot something you can hide.</strong></p><p><strong>What\nis Compassion? </strong></p><p><strong>Most\nof us have a sentimental understanding of what compassion is, but we\nneed to take a step back and try and understand what compassion felt\nlike for Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe are going to understand Jesus, and if we are going to have an\neffective ministry, then we will need to have a proper understanding\nof compassion. </strong></p><p><strong>COMPASSION\nIS A NEGATIVE EMOTION.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nGreek word for COMPASSION is Splagchnizomai; this is a very strong\nword. Originally, the word was used to describe the inward parts, or\nthe entrails of a sacrificial animal. They were removed, roasted and\neaten as part of a sacrificial meal.  Later the word came to mean\nsacrificial meal.   </strong></p><p><strong>The\nword furthered developed to mean human entrails. The idea behind the\nword is to be moved in your guts. It carries the idea that you feel\nso distressed and upset about someone else's need, that you feel\nphysically sick.</strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhen we read about Jesus being moved with compassion, we are reading\nabout a man in pain, a man who is feeling the deep painful reality of\nauthentic love for others. </strong></p><p><strong>How\n\twe handle the pain caused by others will determine our ability to\n\tfeel compassion for them.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nmishandling of pain is often the biggest hindrance to how we minister\nonto others. I love the way Jesus dealt with what He was going\nthrough. He did not grit his teeth, clench His fists and be strong.\nHe did not allow public demands prevent Him from grieving. He did not\nact Mr cool and give the impression He was able to cope. Often we\nread, \u201cHe withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place,\u201d\nhowever that was not always to pray. Often He withdrew because He was\nin pain. He did not pretend.</strong></p><p><strong>Because\nHe dealt honestly with His own pain, when He needed to feel\ncompassion for others, He was able to.  If we feel the need to be\nstrong and prove ourselves, if we think we need to have all the\nanswers, then we will never take time off, we will never withdraw, we\nwill never give ourselves the time and space to deal with our own\nhurting emotions. Then we will never be able to show compassion</strong></p><p><strong>The\nworst thing we could ever do is not be honest about our pain. When we\nbegin to pretend to be strong or to be in control when we are not,\nthen we begin to relate to others on the basis of a lie.</strong></p><p><strong>Because\nothers have hurt us, we can fear the pain of compassion.  Compassion\nis not a comfortable emotion, in some ways it feels as painful as\nrejection or grief.  However, the pain of compassion, although\ndifficult to live with, will bring about a healthy motivation to help\nothers.  Often our motivation for being involved with people is wrong\nor misplaced. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nPharisees said, \"It is by the prince of demons that he drives\nout demons.\" Surely Jesus you need to build up some walls, you\nneed to protect yourself, and you need to be strong and prove\nyourself. It is too risky to care for others, too painful. Compassion\nmeans that you choose to become emotionally involved with people, We\nchoose to get emotionally involved, despite the hurt and\nmisunderstanding of others. </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nMay I never put you call on my life in the place of compassion,</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Psalms 69:55-71:16</p>",

Those who are not free will not have the\ncourage to confront difficult issues, because the Pharisees had\nauthority but no freedom, and they ended up abusing people.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nreason why Jesus was able to give authority to these men was because\nhe was free in himself. If he hadn\u2019t been enjoying his freedom,\nthen he would have never have given authority to his disciples.  </strong></p><p><strong>One\nof the indications that a leader is not free is that he will feel the\nneed to do every thing himself. Jesus could have thought, \u201cthis\nwork is far too important to hand over to these men, this is a work\nof world proportions, \u2018these men are too week, too inexperienced,\ntoo unreliable, too undependable to do this great work\u201d  But Jesus\ndid not think that way, because he was free. His freedom had nothing\nto do with the success or failure of his ministry. But his ministry\nhad everything to do with his freedom.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nwhole purpose of the teaching of Jesus in this passage is to show us\nhow to maintain our freedom. </strong><strong>\n  We can lose our freedom very easily, a wrong reaction to fear,\nworry, rejection our any other pressure that ministry can throw up,\ncan rob us of our freedom. Once your freedom goes, so does authentic\nministry.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to note what Jesus did here. He gave them authority to drive out\nevil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.  He did not give\nthem authority over people. Only people who are not free need to have\nauthority over people.    </strong></p><p><strong>What\nis the basis of the freedom Jesus has given to us. Matthew tells us\n\u201cHe called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority.\u201d \nThe word he uses for called is very interesting. PROSKALEO. It means\nto summon. Was use by a superior over someone under them. It is a\nvery intense word, which meant to call someone to you in order to\nconfront him or her face to face.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nis the basis of our freedom. When Jesus calls us primarily his call\nis to fellowship with him, called to him. Therefore it is in the\ncontext of that intimate fellowship, Jesus confronts us. There can be\nno authority without freedom. No freedom without confrontation. No\nconfrontation without fellowship.   </strong></p><p><strong>The\nfreedom Jesus gives us should be one of the biggest motivations for\nspiritual warfare.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay my ministry be an expression of internal freedom, free from the\ndominate control of my insecurities. </strong><em><strong>\nBible in a year reading plan Psalms 73:21-76:7</strong></em></p>",

      "Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: \u201cDo not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: \u2018The kingdom of heaven has come near. \u2019Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. \u201cDo not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts\u2014 no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. As you enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. \u201cI am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you \u201cBrother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. \u201cThe student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! \u201cSo do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father\u2019s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don\u2019t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. \u201cWhoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven. \u201cDo not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn \u201c\u2018 a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law\u2014a man\u2019s enemies will be the members of his own household.\u2019 \u201cAnyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. \u201cAnyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet\u2019s reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person\u2019s reward. And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.\u201d"

Jesus begins by saying,</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\"Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the\nSamaritans.  Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n One of the mistakes of many missions and churches is that they\neither have no strategy or their strategy is too wide or too general.\nJesus is saying that Ministry must be tied down to specifics. If it\ntoo broad, then nothing will get done, and if it is to narrow then it\nwill become too inflexible.  How did Jesus set the strategy of\nreaching the lost house of Israel at this time? There were five\ncontributing facts that helped Jesus set this strategy.</strong></p><p><strong>A.\n He was emotionally effected by the situation on the ground. We are\ntold by Matthew that has we have seen, \u201cWhen Jesus saw the crowds\nhe had compassion on the.\u201d Strategy for mission must always begin\nin the heart not the mind.   Strategy for ministry, which is devoid\nof emotional involvement, will become cold orthodoxy, and will be\nvery hard to be implemented. When strategy and emotions combined\nthere is more change of seeing the strategy implemented. If we do not\nmake some emotional investment into the lives of those we are trying\nto reach, then when the pressure comes we will be more able to keep\ngoing because we have heart involvement</strong></p><p><strong>B.\nHe prayed about what he saw and how he felt. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u201cAsk the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest\nfield.\u2019 </strong></span><strong>Having\nan adequate emotional respire is not enough, we must also have our\nhart responses checked by the wisdom of cooperate prayer.  When we\nturn the passion of our hearts into effective prayer, then we will be\nmore able to see the way forward. Prayer gives our enthusiasm\ndirection.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to ask the Question. What can we learn from,</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\ndirections regarding praying for the harvest field? </strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cAsk\nthe Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest field\u201d\n</strong></span><strong>The\nword he uses for \u201cSend out\u201d is an extremely strong word, it\nliterally means to drive out your enemies. In the LXX the word is\nused in the context where an enemy, frustrating or standing in the\nway of God\u2019s fulfilling his purpose for his chosen people, is \u2018cast\nout\u2019 by God, so that God\u2019s purposes may be fulfilled. See Exodus\n23:30 Deuteronomy 33:27ff. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nword was mostly used in the New Testament in relation to casting out\ndemons. It is the same word Jesus uses in verse 1 of chapter 10,\nwhere he says, \u201cHe gave them authority to drive out demons.\u201d This\nis very helpful.   Jesus wants the people God sends out to be a\npassionate expression of God\u2019s Ekballo, Or God\u2019s resistance to\nevil.   The people God is sending out are Gods answer to Satan, and\nhis kingdom.   God wants his passion to been seen through our lives. \n     </strong></p><p><strong>This\nis the same word Mark uses in 1:12 when it says, \u201cAt once the\nSpirit sent him into the desert.\u201d We know that Jesus went into the\ndesert to confront Satan. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nword is also found in Mark 11:15</strong><strong>\nOn reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area and began\ndriving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned\nthe tables of the moneychangers and the benches of those selling\ndove. </strong></p><p><strong>Luke\n13:28 \u201cThere will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you\nsee Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the Kingdom of\nGod, but yourself thrown out.\u201d </strong></p><p><strong>So\nthe intent behind the word is one of God opposing evil that is been\ndone to others. </strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>There\nis another principle expressed through Jesus\u2019 use of Ekballo, As we\nhave said, it is a very passionate word. God desires to express his\npassion through us. If our lives do not express God\u2019s passion, then\nthey will not express his love. God\u2019s love and God\u2019s passion are\ninseparable. God\u2019s love for us is a passionate love.     Can a\nheart with no passion express God\u2019s love???   </strong></p><p><strong>It\nis interesting to observe from the life of Jesus that he never had\napathy in his heart, he often felt tired, or weary, or even\ndiscouraged. But he never allowed apathy in his heart. Our English\nword apathy comes from the Greek word APEITHEO that is used to\ndescribe disobedience or unbelief in the New Testament. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\ntells his disciples to, said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cAsk\nthe Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest field\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nwhat kind of people did he have in mind. What was he thinking about\nwhen he spoke about workers?  </strong></p><p><strong>What\nwe have in our hearts will determine what kind of workers we will be.\nIf we are experiencing the Ekballo in our hearts then we are going to\nbe the kind of workers Jesus wants us to be. When Jesus calls for\nworkers to be sent into the harvest he is referring to a hired hand,\na slave, someone who is paid a low wage.  Someone who has no high\nambition for them selves. Someone who is not afraid of hard work.  </strong></p><p><strong>The\nhumble commitment required by a worker in God\u2019s harvest field is\nonly possible when God works in someone\u2019s heart. We must be\nenergized by what God is doing in us, often we lack the emotional and\nspiritual resources to labour for God because inside we are not\nexperiencing the passion of God.  </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nI would love to have a heat full of your strategic passion.</strong><em><strong>\nBible in a year reading plan Psalms 78:25-72</strong></em></p>",

      "Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.

Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. As you enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. \u201cI am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues.

Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. \u201cThe student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master.

Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?

    "html": "<p><strong>WE\nNEED TO REALIZE THAT SPIRITUAL WARFARE IS PROACTIVE NOT REACTIVE. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nverses 7-8b we see the Apostles operating at three levels at the same\ntime.  The have a message from God.  </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cAs\nyou go, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'</strong></span><strong>\nThey have a ministry among men </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'Heal\nthe sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy,.....\u201d</strong></span><strong>.\nAnd they have a confrontation with evil </strong><strong>\u201c....drive\nout demons.\u201d</strong><strong>\nWhat can we learn about Spiritual warfare from this context.</strong></p><p><strong>A.\n For Jesus spiritual warfare was responding and cooperating to what\nGod is doing, not reacting to what Satan is doing. Spiritual warfare\nis more an expression of the activity of God than the activity of\nSatan. Jesus is more than a deliver from spiritual warfare, often he\nis the initiator of Spiritual warfare.</strong></p><p><strong>B.\nThe spiritual warfare Jesus calls us to will always help other\npeople.  As the apostles confronted the demons and drove them out, \npeople were helped, people were set free. The Spiritual warfare Jesus\ncalls us to is always for the benefit of others. Those who are the\nbiggest threat to Satan will be the biggest help to people. </strong></p><p><strong>C.\nSpiritual warfare is God\u2019s initiative. Jesus was sending the\nApostles us to confront the demons.  This perspective on spiritual\nwarfare is more positive and healthy.  When the power of God is\nworking in our lives then we will be unable to avoid confrontation\nwith Satan. </strong></p><p><strong>4.OUR\nMINISTRY MUST ALWAYS BE AN EXPRESSION OF GRACE. Jesus concludes verse\n8 by saying, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cfreely\nyou have received, freely give\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nThis is one of those sayings that would be very easily to read over\nand miss their impact. Here Jesus is addressing a number of issues.</strong></p><p><strong>A.\nTHE ISSUE OF MOTIVE.  Most bible scholars apply this verse to the\nwhole area of money. They say things like. \u201cWe must never sell the\ngospel, we should never use it to line our own pockets.\u201d This\napplication is legitimate, but too restrictive.</strong></p><p><strong>Many\npeople are involved in Christian ministry for reasons that may not be\nrelated to, money, but are just as wrong.   If we are using ministry\nas a means of getting status, or significance, or reputation. Then we\nare not freely given to others, we are expecting something back in\nreturn.   Any hidden agenda will prevent the message of the kingdom\nfor being shared freely. We may not be looking for finical reward,\nbut the reward we are looking for is just as wrong and dangerous.</strong></p><p><strong>B.\nTHE ISSUE OF GRACE.  We will only be able to freely give to others,\nwithout having a hidden agenda when we are receiving and enjoying the\ngrace of God in our own lives. If we are not ministering out of a\ndeep sense of the grace of God, then we always be looking for\nsomething in return We will always expect people to give to us for\nthe ministry we are doing for them. We may not be looking for finical\nreward, but we will be looking for something. We won't give freely.</strong></p><p><strong>EXPRESSING\nTHE POWER OF GOD IS NOT ENOUGH, WE ALSO MUST EXPRESS THE LOVE OF God.\n</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cFreely\nyou have received, freely give\u201d</strong></span><strong>\n The word Matthew uses for give DIDOMI as more to do with the\nintention behind the gift than the act of giving. In giving their\nmust be a transparency about us. Our ministry must never hide or\nconceal any alliterative motive., but how we share the message with\nother should be done as an expression of none intimidating openness. </strong></p><p><strong>An\nillustration of how this word works is seen in a child buying his\nmother a present for mother\u2019s day. The present may be very cheep,\nor very tacky, it may even be ugly, and probably useless, yet despite\nthe apparent worthlessness of the present the mother receives it, in\nfact she receives it with Joy. Why?  Because she knows that this\nchild is giving the gift as an expression of love. </strong></p><p><strong>If\npeople know that we love them, and they see our love because we are\ntransparent, then we be secure enough to share the gospel in\nspontaneous and natural ways. </strong></p><p><strong>When\npeople see what\u2019s in our hearts, and see that we have genuine love\nform them, then it will not matter how slick or professional or how\nable we are to share the free grace of God.  </strong></p><p><strong>THE\nATTITUDE OF OUR HEARTS DETERMINES IF THE GOSPEL THAT WE SHARE IS A\nGIFT OR NOT. </strong></p><p><strong>What\nkind of heart attitude do we require if we want to share a gift with\nsomeone? Sharing the message of the kingdom without expressing\ngenuine love is putting burdens on others and ourselves.  Only those\nwho are broken and have freely received grace will be able to share\ngrace freely.  If the gospel ceases to be a gift because of the\nattitude of our hearts, we will turn to methodology and slick\nprogrammes. Or we will parrot out clich\u00e9s in an attempt to share the\ngospel. The gospel is easier to receive when it is shared as a gift..</strong></p><p><strong>Having\na heart that shares the gospel as a gift is the only kind of heart\nattitude that is able to cope with the demands of spiritual warfare. </strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe are not freely receiving the grace of God, and are unable to share\nfreely the grace God, then when we face the pressure of spiritual\nwarfare, we will wont to back of. Because having a hidden agenda will\ncause us to disengage from in presser or circumstance which will\nthreaten or agenda</strong></p><p><strong>C.\nTHE ISSUE OF THE SCOPE OF OUR MINISTRY. Their is nothing more\nlimiting to someone\u2019s ministry than a hidden agenda. When we are\nmotivated by a hidden agenda, then we will be restrictive in how we\nminister and to who we minister, our whole focus will be on meeting\nour needs, not the needs of others. but when we \u201cfreely give\u201d we\nwill have the freedom to reach out to all people, for we will expect\nnothing in return</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that spiritual warfare is your initiative    </strong><em><strong>\nBible in a year reading plan Psalms 83-86.</strong></em></p>",

If the home is\ndeserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace\nreturn to you.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nIn our culture when wee think of the word greeting, we think of\nsaying \u201cHello,\u201d or a hand shake. But the Jewish concept of\ngreeting was much wider and deeper, it was a heartfelt expression of\ndesire for the other persons welfare. The Greek word for  greeting\nwas used to describe the embrace of good friends, communicating love\nand respect.  So the role of the Christian  is to be a source of\nblessing to others.  We will never reach people for the Lord until\nthe feel comfortable in our presence. </strong></p><p><strong>But\nwe need to ask the question. How can I be a blessing to others? </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nsaid, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cIf\nthe home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let\nyour peace return to you.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\n- let your peace rest on it; These words are the key to how we should\napproach others, and how we can be a source of blessing to others.\nJesus did not say \u201cLet God\u2019s peace rest on it, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>but\nlet your peace rest on it.</strong></span><strong>\nJesus is saying that the only way we can be a blessing to others is\nto reach out to them from a posture of peace. In other word.. I can\nonly reach out to others if I am experiencing peace In my own life.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nis a massive conformation on much of the thinking and practice of\n21</strong><sup><strong>st</strong></sup><strong>\ncentury Christianity. Many people are involved in ministry in order\nto find peace, Yet Jesus is saying that only those who are experience\npeace will have the ability to reach others. The peace Jesus is\ntalking about is the result of the internal work of the Holy Spirit\nin someone\u2019s life.  It has nothing to do with external\ncircumstances. People who are enjoying the internal peace of God are\nbest equipped to embrace others, giving them a blessing.</strong></p><p><strong>ONLY\nPEOPLE WHO ARE AT PEACE HAVE THE COURAGE TO WALK AWAY.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nconcludes his principles for ministry by saying </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018If\nanyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust\noff your feet when you leave that home or town.  I tell you the\ntruth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorra on the day of\njudgment than for that town. </strong></span><strong>\n Every one will not receive the message of the kingdom, most will\nreject it. Jesus says that their will come a time when you will have\nto walk away, But the problem is knowing when it is right to walk\naway, and when is it right to preserver. Jesus did not give us a\nformula but he did give us some guidelines that would help us know\nwhen it is right to shake the dust of our feet and move on somewhere\nelse.</strong></p><p><strong>IT\n\tIS BETTER TO LOOSE YOUR MINISTRY THAN LOOSE YOUR PEACE.  </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018As\n\tyou enter the home, give it your greeting.  If the home is\n\tdeserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace\n\treturn to you.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\n\tIf we are ever in a situation where we will have to compromise our\n\tinner peace, where the only way we can continue is to violate some\n\tspiritual principle and our peace in the process, then it is better\n\tto walk away.  </strong></p><p><strong>We\n\tneed to have a biblical understanding of peace. When the bible\n\tspeaks about peace, it is not solely referring to feeling good, more\n\timportantly, it is referring to seance of well-being because of your\n\trelationship with God, completeness, soundness.  Peace is everything\n\tgiven by God, in all areas of life. </strong></p><p><strong>THE\nGOAL OF REACHING PEOPLE MUST NEVER BECOME MORE IMPORTANT THAN OUR\nRELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. \t </strong></p><p><strong>B.\nOUR PEACE IS THREATENED WHEN OUR MINISTRY HINDERS OR CONFLICTS WITH\nTHE ONGOING WORK GOD IS DOING IN US.</strong></p><p><strong>An\nother guideline for knowing when it is time to walk away is when a\nperson's ministry undermines what God is doing in them as\nindividuals. Any conflict between God\u2019s work in us and God\u2019s work\nthrough us, will erode a persons peace. This happens a lot, where\npeople in some kind of full time ministry confuse their ministry with\nspiritual growth, they confuse what they are doing as people with who\nthey are as people.  They confuse what they are doing for God with\nwhat God is doing in them. This confusion is the antithesis to peace,\nsoundness, well being, and wholeness. </strong></p><p><strong>Some\nquestions that will help us discern if we should be walking away.</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nAre we growing as people. Is their evident change in our walk with\nGod?</strong></p><p><strong>2.\nAre we conscious of significant good change in our relationship with\nGod?</strong></p><p><strong>3.\nAre we aware of what God is doing in us and saying to us?</strong></p><p><strong>4.\nIs the sphere of ministry I am involved in being used of God to\nmature me?</strong></p><p><strong>5.\nIs my life characterized with biblical peace?</strong></p><p><strong>It\nwould be very easy for this principle to be misunderstood or\nmisapplied. There will be situations that we will face where we will\nfeel uncomfortable and out of our depth, and God will want us to stay\nthere. I am not suggestion that once we feel uncomfortable we should\nrun away. But I am saying once a situation compromises your\nrelationship with God then you will know that it is time to move on.\nOnce you have to compromise a spiritual principle to maintain you\nministry, then you will have lost you peace, and it is time to move\non.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay </strong><em><strong>I\nnever make spiritual compromise in order </strong></em><strong>to</strong><em><strong>\npreserve a ministry</strong></em></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Psalms 89:38-91:13</p>",

The\nrest of the chapter Jesus talks about the pressure of ministry.\nMatthew 10:16-42</strong></p><p><strong>A.\nJesus spends more time in talking about the stress, strain, and\npressure of ministry that he does about the success or achievements\nof ministry, why?  Because How we handle the pressure and pain of\nministry will be a more authentic indication of our spirituality than\na successful ministry would be. </strong></p><p><strong>B.\nJesus is more concerned about those who are doing the work than the\nwork they are doing, so he has more to say about how they handle\nthemselves under pressure than he has to say about what they are\ndoing. </strong></p><p><strong>C.\nIn this passage Jesus says more about inner attitude that he does\nabout practical steps we could take to avoid the pressure of\nministry. Look at some of the attitudes Jesus encourages.</strong></p><p><strong>A.\nBe Shrewd, 16a</strong></p><p><strong>B.\nBe innocent, 16b.</strong></p><p><strong>C.\nBe on your guard. 17a.</strong></p><p><strong>D.\nDo not worry, 19a.</strong></p><p><strong>E.\nBe humble like Jesus 24 - 25</strong></p><p><strong>F.\nDo not be afraid. 26a.</strong></p><p><strong>G.\nDo not be afraid of those who kill the body 28a.</strong></p><p><strong>H.\nFear Him (God) who destroys both body and soul in hell. 28b.</strong></p><p><strong>I.\nDo not be afraid for you are valuable. 31.</strong></p><p><strong>J.\nLove Jesus above all 37.</strong></p><p><strong>K.\nLoose you life 39.</strong></p><p><strong>So\nhow we react to the pressure of ministry as nothing to do with the\nsource or nature of specific pressure, but more to do with what is,\n(or what is not in) our hearts. </strong></p><p><strong>It\nis important to notice what Jesus did not tell these disciples to do\nwhen they were under pressure. He did not say remember your call,\nremember what I have called you to. Often people use the call of God\nupon their lives as a means of being faithful and persistence,.I have\noften herd it said that when things get tough, you recall the time\nGod called you and this will keep you going. On the surface this\nsound spiritual and even helpful. But if we were to consider this\nphilosophy a bit deeper, you will discover that it is both dangerous\nand unhelpful.</strong></p><p><strong>Spiritual\nexperience of the past (the call) will never see a person through the\ncrisis of the present. The only way a person can cope with the\npressure of the present is to develop their relationship with God in\nthe NOW.

Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. \u201cThe student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master.

This is like saying God makes me ill, so I\ncan go into hospital, in order to witness to the person dying on the\nbed beside mine!  God allowed me to be burgled so I could witness to\nthe thief.</strong></p><p><strong>DO\nNOT WORRY</strong></p><p><strong>There\nare a number of problems with understanding of this verse, and on a\nsuperficial reading you could think that Jesus was being to\nidealistic. Do not worry about what to say. This is an opportunity to\nwitness before governors and kings.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus tells them do not worry, He is not giving them a command, nor\nis he telling to live in denial. This is not a call to be brave, or\nto be strong, or to clinch your fists, grit your teeth, put your\nheads down and suffer no matter what. This kind of approach to\npersecution will ensure that we will not be able to cope.  </strong></p><p><strong>However,\nit is a call to be dependent, to find your security in your\nrelationship with God. It is an opportunity to allow the Holy Spirit\nto work in you. but he is saying that when we have hearts that are\nfree, and when we are wise and innocent, then we will be less\ninclined to worry. </strong></p><p><strong>What\nkind of person would not worry under such circumstances? Someone who\nhas understood every thing Jesus has said up to this point, someone\nthat is finding his or her life in God. But if we are not free on\ninside, then we will feel threatened, and we will worry, wanting to\npreserve the freedom we think we have.</strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhen Jesus tells us </strong><strong>\n</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cfreely\nyou have received, freely give,</strong></span><strong>\u201d\nHe knows that being free on the inside, and presenting the Gospel as\na free gift, will have a huge effect on how we will respond to\npersecution.  </strong></p><p><strong>DO\nWITNESS, BUT DO IT BECAUSE YOU ARE FREE.</strong></p><p><strong>But\nthere is another problem. When any one is brought before a local\ncouncil, a governor, or kings, especially in the days of Jesus. You\nknew at lest you could be flogged or even loose your life. Nothing in\nour natural lives will feel the desire to witness. So is Jesus being\nnaive, or even cruel, expecting his disciples to witness before\noppressive tyrants. So how are we to understand this?</strong></p><p><strong>For\nin verse 20 he says  </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cBut\nwhen they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say\nit. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be\nyou speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nWhat Jesus is saying here is dynamic.  </strong></p><p><strong>Many\npeople see this verse, as Jesus seeing persecution as an opportunity\nfor witnessing. But this is to miss the point. The witness we give is\nmore about what we are not what we say. The witness we give has more\nto do with how we respond to the persecution, not in how we defend\nourselves from the persecution, or challenge the persecution. The\nwitness we give is the result of God working in us, not us trying to\nbe strong, or have answers, or learning the latest method of\nspiritual self-defense.   </strong></p><p><strong>If,</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u201cfreely you have received, freely give,\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nis true about our hearts, then witnessing will be just spontaneous.\nStanding before a court, will never threaten the freedom of a\nChristian. However, if we are not free, then we will see this as a\nrule, something we feel we have to do. </strong></p><p><strong>We\ncould even think that because we witness, and made a stand, and\nshared or faith, then God will be glorified. But God is only\nglorified if we witness from a posture of freedom and dependence.</strong></p><p><strong>We\ncould even witness in these kinds of circumstances as an attempt to\nget free, not because we are free. </strong></p><p><strong>A.\nThe answer to persecution is not to see the persecution stop, but the\nlife of the Spirit in the believer.  It is more important to react to\npressure in the Spirit than see the source of the pressure removed.</strong></p><p><strong>B.\nThe biggest threat to the work of God does not come from the pressure\nfrom without, but lack of the life of the spirit in the life of the\nbeliever.</strong></p><p><strong>C.\nBe more concerned about your dependence on God, and the work of the\nHoly Spirit in your life, than about and persecution you may face.</strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes\nthe Holy Spirit will tell you to say nothing.

This is the only time we come across this phrase in the bible,\nBut I think Jesus is saying that life in the Spirit is never\nseparated from intimacy with God our Father, and dependence on God as\nour father. Intimacy and dependence are essential if we are going to\nrespond spiritually to pressure.   </strong></p><p><strong>All\n\tour witnessing should be an expression of freedom.</strong></p><p><strong>If\n\twe are not free outside the court, then we won\u2019t be free inside\n\tthe court. </strong></p><p><strong>Often\n\tdifficulties and pressure reveal what kind of relationship we have\n\tthe God our Father, and with the Holy Spirit. </strong></p><p><strong>2.\nWE WILL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO COPE WITH HOSTILE RELATIONSHIPS IF WE\nARE GOING TO RESPOND PROPERLY TO THE PRESSURE OF MINISTRY. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nverses 21-23 the conflict deepens and becomes more personal. It if\nmuch easier to be persecuted by local authorities or courts, than it\nis to be persecuted by family and people we know and love. Jesus says</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"Brother\nwill betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will\nrebel against their parents and have them put to death.

I tell\nyou the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel\nbefore the Son of Man comes.  </strong></span></p><p><strong>A\ntrue indication of how spiritual we are is seen in how we handle\nrelationships, be they good or bad. In these verses Jesus is telling\nhis disciples that they are going to face difficult relationships,\nand how they respond to those difficult painful relationships is an\nindication of their spirituality.   </strong></p><p><strong>The\ndeepest pain a person can suffer is the pain caused by the\nuncharitable wound of someone we love.  The persecution caused by the\nworld out side is one thing. But the hostility and hatred of a friend\nor a family member is more demanding and more difficult. The word\nMatthew uses for hate in verse 22 is MISEO The word means deep-seated\nabhorrence and hostility towards an other. </strong></p><p><strong>How\nshould the disciples respond to such hatred, what is the appropriate\nresponse to such overt animosity. Jesus tells us  </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cBut\nhe who stands firm shall be saved.\u201d </strong></span><strong>\nWe could very easily misunderstand what Jesus is saying here. When we\nthink of standing firm we think in terms of clinch your fist, grit\nyour teeth, be strong and just endure what comes. But this is not\nwhat Jesus is saying.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nare three important things we need to notice about the word \u201cStand\nfirm\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword stand firm is the Greek word HYPOMENO. It is also translated\npatient. Persevere, endure, be steadfast. The word means to hold you\nground, and was used to describe a soldier staying in the heat of the\nbattle under terrible opposition.  It was also used a proud Greek,\nwho was a free man without responsibilities, but who chooses to\nendure a burden, difficulty or danger without any hope of reward.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword was used as a Christian virtue For example it was used as a\nmeans of expressing love </strong><strong>1\nCor. 13:7</strong><strong>\nLove, It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always\nperseveres.   It is an expression of Joy </strong><strong>Hebrews\n12:2-3</strong><strong>\nLet us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith,\nwho for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame,\nand sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.  Consider him\nwho endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not\ngrow weary and lose heart.  is also an expression of HOPE </strong><strong>Romans\n12:12</strong><strong>\n Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in\nprayer;  </strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhat are we saying. The only way we can cope with undeserved\nhostility, the only way we can stand firm hold our ground is to\nensure that our endurance is motivated by love joy and hope, and\nensure that our endurance is an expression of love joy and hope.\nEndurance which is a sole  expression of self determination will not\nlast.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nmost important thing about handling hostility, is how we handle\nourselves, we will not be able to handle hostility until we learn the\nvalue of self-control and how we should handle ourselves. </strong></p><p><strong>There\nis a third thing abort this word that is extremely important. Jesus\nsaid, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cBut\nhe who stand firm to the end will be saved.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nThe word HYPOMENO also means to remain under. One Greek scholar\ndefines hypomeno as \u201cto remain under a trial in a God honouring way\nas to learn the lessons they are sent to teach rather than attempt\nget our from under them In an effort to be relieved from their\npressure.\u201d   Those who endure, those who find God\u2019s purpose in\nthrough the hostility will be saved. They will not crumble under the\npressure.  When Jesus speaks about being saved here he is not talking\nabout the salvation of our souls, but about dealing with the\nhostility without loosing you commitment to God and his kingdom.</strong></p><p><strong>It\nis interesting to note that more people loose their faith, of leave\nChristina work, not because of difficult circumstances, but because\nthe pain of difficult relationships. </strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus says </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cbut\nhe who stands firm to the end will be saved.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nHe is saying that if we allow bitterness or anger or resentment to\ntake hold in our hearts, then there is no way we will survive thee\nhostility of others.  If our standing firm is not a reflection of\nFaith hope or love, then we will become bitter and angry. You could\nsay that only those who have a robust godly character have the\nability to \u2018stand firm.\u2019  </strong></p><p><strong>What\nlessons can we learn from these verses.</strong></p><p><strong>A.\nIt is possible to fright the right battles in the wrong way. You\ncannot ignore hostility. You must face it and live with it, but this\ncan only done when we our endurance and patients are an expression of\nlove.</strong></p><p><strong>B.\nOften in Christian work the result of fighting the right battle in\nthe wrong way is that any scars we may receive are compounded,\nexaggerated, made worse.  I have meet many people who have been\ndeeply wounded. However, sometimes their wounds have been made worse\nand sometime fatal, (to their faith) because they had the courage to\nstand up and fight for the right things. But their fight or endurance\nwas not an expression of love and joy. They have stood firm at the\nexpense of ceasing to love.  Often the deepest wounds in Christian\nwork are self inflicted. We may have good reason to blame others. But\nif we are standing firm if we are HYPMENO then their is less chance\nof being permanently scared. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\ngoes on to clarify that the </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cStanding\nFirm\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nhe refers to in verse 22, is more to do with a person spiritual\ncondition than their physical condition. For in verse 23</strong><strong>\n</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cWhen\nyou are persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the\ntruth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before\nthe Son of Man comes.\u201d </strong></span><strong>\nThe Greek word Jesus uses for persecuted is DIOKO which means to be\nput to flight, to pursue, to drive away, To hunt down. Standing Firm\ndoes not mean that you must stay in the way of physical danger,\nStanding firm may mean that you will need to flee. </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay my heart have the right spiritual qualities that will enable me\nto stand firm. </strong><em><strong>\nBible in a year reading plan Psalms 102:8-104:4</strong></em></p>",

These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: \u201cDo not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: \u2018The kingdom of heaven has come near. \u2019Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. \u201cDo not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts\u2014 no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. As you enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. \u201cI am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you \u201cBrother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. \u201cThe student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub, how much more the members of his household! \u201cSo do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father\u2019s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don\u2019t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. \u201cWhoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven. \u201cDo not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn \u201c\u2018 a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law\u2014a man\u2019s enemies will be the members of his own household.\u2019 \u201cAnyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. \u201cAnyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet\u2019s reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person\u2019s reward. And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.\u201d"

It\nis enough for the student to be like his teacher, and the servant\nlike his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub,\nhow much more the members of his household! </strong></span><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to understand what these people were saying when the called\nJesus Beelzebub, and how it deeply effected Jesus.  The word is found\nseven times in the new Testament, and always in the context of the\nPharisees misjudging Jesus. On a number of occasions they claimed\nthat the work Jesus was doing was inspired by Satan, the prince of\ndemons, see Matt 9:34.  What does Beelzebub mean.</strong></p><p><strong>Some\nbelieve that it has an Old Testament origin. King Ahaziah, in an act\nof apostasy, sent to inquire of \"Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron,\"\none of the Philistine cities (II Kings 1:2-16). The two parts of\n\"Baal-zebub\" means, \"lord of the fly.\" Baal was\nthe Canaanite god of fertility and fire, one of the chief deities of\nthe area. Zebub means fly or poisonous insect (the same word is used\nof one of the plagues of Egypt, Exodus. 8:20-32). The Philistines may\nhave actually worshiped the fly, </strong></p><p><strong>In\nMark 3:22 (= Matt. 12:24; cf. 9:34; Luke 11:15) the Pharisees\ndenigrate Jesus and attempt to explain his power over demons as\nitself of demonic origin by saying, \"He has Beelzebub, the\nprince of the demons.\" Others think the precise meaning of\nBeelzebub is uncertain. Yet it certainly is related to the name of\nthe pagan deity associated with the enduring enemy of Israel.  It can\nalso mean, Lord of the house, or higher abode. In the sense that\noften the pagan temples were often located on high ground. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nthese verses Jesus shares some of the pain of his own heart, to be\ncalled Beelzebub cause Jesus some pain, it made an impact on Jesus,\nWhy did Jesus think it was important to share this incident? There\nmay be two possible reasons. Because they were suggesting that Jesus\u2019\nministry had a demonic origin and not a divine one.  It would be like\nsomeone in a public position declaring that you were demonized,\ntherefore, who you are, and what you do is both wrong and dangerous. \nThey were not only attacking his ministry, but they were attacking\nwho he was so they could undermine his ministry. </strong></p><p><strong>Secondly,\nWhen the Pharisees attributed the miracles of Jesus to Satan, it was\ntheir first overt public attack on Him. Up to this point in Matthew\u2019s\ngospel their criticism of Jesus had either been in private, Matthew\n9:3, or implicit Matthew 9:11. It was only after a period of time\nthat their hate came out. And when it did come out, it was terrible. \n</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nwas not immune to feeling pain, what people said effected him, he did\nnot have some emotional body armor to protect him, but as he shares\nhis pain, as an illustration to help his disciples. He also shared\nhow he coped with these evil allegations.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nJesus the head of the household was treated badly, then what can we\nexpect. We must not be surprised when we are treated badly. But as a\nmeans of helping us cope with ill treatment Jesus says that if we\nhave the attitude of a servant, if we have the attitude of a student\nthen we will be better equipped to handle pressure.</strong></p><p><strong>A.\nThe importance of being a servant.</strong></p><p><strong>How\nwe handle insults will depend on how we think about ourselves. Being\na servant, and being a student is the antithesis of having a\nreputation. If in your heart you have an attitude of a servant, a\ndolous, someone who has no rights, someone who has subordinated his\nwill to his master, Someone who has no aspirations for greatness or\npower. When this kind of person is insulted, it will not destroy or\neffect him deeply, because he has the attitude of a slave.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nour reputation is too important, when we feel that we need to protect\nour standing, then the insults will become more damaging. Then we\nwill use our energies in making sure that people think highly of us. \nMaybe one of the reasons why so many fold under the pressure of\nministry is because they are more concerned about guarding their\nreputation than they are about being servants and students</strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe have hearts that are servant hearts, not only will their be a\npractical service towards others, but being a servant in your heart,\nwill prevent you from reacting to the criticism and misunderstanding\nof others.  If our reputation is important, then we will crumble when\nwe are being wrongly accused. </strong></p><p><strong>Only\nthose who know the security of being slaves, those who are dependant\non someone else to meet their needs, someone who has no resources of\ntheir own, then and only then will they be able to share in the\nsufferings of Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>B.\nThe importance of being a student. The Greek word for student is\nwhere we get our English word for mathematics from, It carries the\nidea of someone who is teachable, open to learn.  It is not\nsufficient Just to know how to handle pressure. But part of the\nprocess of handling pressure is that we learn from it. The pressure\nbecomes a teaching tool in the hand of God, through which he changes\nus. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nwas both a servant and a student. In his heart he was submissive to\nhis father, Because of this heart attitude he was able to serve\nothers, fulfil His fathers will, and cope with the criticism and\nhatred of others. </strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe find it hard to be a servant and a learner, then we will not have\nthe ability to respond spiritually to the hatred we may face.  So\nhaving a servant heart and a teachable spirit are essential if we are\ngoing to handle conflict. </strong></p><p><em>\n<strong>Father\nmay I have the spiritual maturity to cope with hostility Bible in a\nyear reading plan Psalms</strong></em><strong>\n1105:24-106:33</strong></p>",

    "html": "<p><strong>HOW\nTO HANDLE FEAR.</strong></p><p><strong>One\nof the greatest needs we have when it comes to coping spiritually\nwith suffering is having the resources to handle fear. The Greek word\nfor fear in the word we get phobia, Jesus instructions about how we\nshould handle fear are very interesting.  Most of us think that the\nbest way to handle fear is to change our circumstances, or change the\npeople who are causing us to fear. But the advice Jesus gives has\nmore to do with our inner attitudes and our relationship with God. So\nthe key to handling fear is not external but internal.</strong></p><p><strong>Matthew\n10:26-31</strong><strong>\n</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"So\ndo not be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed that will not be\ndisclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.  What I tell you in\nthe dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear,\nproclaim from the roofs.  Do not be afraid of those who kill the body\nbut cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can\ndestroy both soul and body in hell.  Are not two sparrows sold for a\npenny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the\nwill of your Father.  And even the very hairs of your head are all\nnumbered.  So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows</strong></span><strong>.\n </strong></p><p><strong>There\nis nothing more damaging than fear in the heart of a man. Fear can\nparalyze and stop a person from being able to minister. In some ways\nthe which we handle fear is more important than how we handle\nsuffering or pain. One of t</strong><strong>he\nmeanings of the word Phobeo is to be put to flight, this is why Jesus\nspends a lot of time covering this subjects, in verse 26-31. Fear can\nput us to flight, and cause us to run away from facing issues in our\nown hearts. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\ncovers every area of our lives and how it relates to fear. </strong></p><p><strong>Fear\n\tin relation to our integrity.</strong></p><p><strong>Fear\n\tin relation to our circumstances.</strong></p><p><strong>Fear\n\tin relation to Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>Fear\n\tin relation to Satan.</strong></p><p><strong>Fear\n\tin relation to God.</strong></p><p><strong>Fear\n\tin relation to ourselves.</strong></p><p><strong>Three\ntimes in this short passage Jesus repeats the words </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cSo\ndo not be afraid.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\nBut how do we do that? Is their some way we can control or handle our\nfear. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nthis teaching Jesus give us six ways to handle fear.</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nTHOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.  \tJesus said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018So\ndo not be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed that will not be\ndisclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nJesus is saying that he wants us to live transparent honest lives.\nLives that are open to be scrutinize and examined.  The word Jesus\nuses for hidden is Kruptos from which we get our English word\ncryptic. The word was used to describe an inward secret. The word for\nconceal is slightly different. It means to cover up, to hide, to\nhinder. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nthings we hide may be sinful, like lust, pride anger or other heart\nattitudes. On the other hand, they may not be sinful, it may be a\nweakness or an inferiority. If we attempt to hide a weakness or\ninferiority, it will probably lead to a sinful heart attitude.  \nThose who live lives that are honest, open, transparent will be less\naffected by fear.   </strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe have a hidden agenda, or when we employ emotional energy in trying\nto hide a weakness or a sin, then we will be more open to fear,\nespecially the fear others.  Being honest, open people will prevent\nus from fearing others. Keeping things hidden will make our hearts\nmore open to fear. </strong></p><p><strong>One\nof the reasons why we need the constant confrontation of Jesus is so\nwe will be kept from having hearts that are fear-full. Only the grace\nof God can keep us from the hiding game, and preserve our integrity\nand freedom. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to deal with issues in our hearts if we are going to be set free\nfrom fear. We need to uncover areas of our lives to the healing\nsunshine of God\u2019s grace.  Often the people who hide the most, are\nthe ones that fear the most. </strong></p><p><strong>2.\nTHOSE WHO ARE LISTENING IN THE DARK HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.  </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2019What\nI tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight;\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nOften Jesus uses dark situation or circumstances to teach us about\nourselves and about himself. When we see our difficulties as God\ndesigned appointments to deepen our communion with him, and to\nincrease our ability to listen to Him then we will be less likely to\nfear.   When we are not listening in the dark then our fear will\ninevitable grow. </strong></p><p><strong>What\nJesus says to me in the darkness is more important than what the\ndarkness can do to me. There are some things God can only tell us in\nthe dark. Often we learn our deepest lessons about ourselves and\nabout God in the dark.  Sometimes God uses the darkness to bring\nlight into our lives. This must had been a great encouragement to the\ndisciples. To know that in the dark they would be more open to hear\nwhat Jesus had to say to them.</strong></p><p><strong>Notice\nthe order Jesus puts these in, If we are not honest and real about\nwhat is in our hearts, when the darkness comes, we will not be able\nto hear what Jesus is saying to us.  If we have fear in our hearts\nbecause of things we have hidden, when the darkness comes that fear\nis going to be increased. Maybe the darkness is one of the ways Jesus\ncan uncover what we have hidden?</strong></p><p><strong>THOSE\nWHO ARE ENJOYING INTIMACY WITH JESUS HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.  Jesus\ncontinues. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018what\nis whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nMatthew 10:27b During New Testament times Jewish rabbis would often\ntrain their students to speak by standing beside them and whispering\nin their ears. What the student heard whispered he would then speak\naloud. This intimacy often produced boldness, and enabled them to\nproclaim their message from the rooftops.   </strong></p><p><strong>We\nwill only have the boldness and courage to speak when we are enjoying\nintimacy with Jesus, when we a close enough to hear his whispers.\nThose who have the security of intimacy will not fear what others can\ndo to them.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus tells them to proclaim from the roofs. The word for proclaims\nis the same word for preach.  The word is KERUSSO, which comes from\nthe Greek word KERUBBEN to preach. The word was used to describe the\nwork of a herald in a Greek city. His message came with all authority\nof the civic authorities, The word was also used to describe someone\nwho attends a prince. Or someone who duties were in keeping with a\nhigh court official. He was someone who spoke with authority. </strong></p><p><strong>Intimacy,\nboldness and authority should be characterized that mark our\nministry, but they are also things that should protect us from the\nfear of people. But we must always remember that boldness and\nauthority are impossible without intimacy.</strong></p><p><strong>4.\nTHOSE WHO REALISE THAT THEIR ENEMY HAS LIMITATIONS WILL NOT FEAR. \nJesus continues in Matthew 10:28 by saying </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018</strong></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>Do\nnot be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.\nRather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in\nhell.\u2019</strong></span></p><p><strong>The\nNew Testament uses a Hebrew word to describe Hell. The word Geenna,\nGeenna was thought to be a valley located outside Jerusalem used as a\ncity rubbish dump, where all the refuge was burned</strong></p><p><strong>In\nthe New Testament there are 14 references to the word HELL. Of these\n14 references Jesus spoke 12 of theme. Of the 12 spoken by Jesus 9\nwere spoken to Christians, not none Christians, Two were addressed to\nthe Pharisees., One of the references it is unclear who Jesus was\nspeaking to.  The two references that were not spoken by Jesus were\nalso addressed to Christians. See James 3:6 2Peter 2:4  </strong></p><p><strong>This\nverse is saying that there are certain things that your enemy cannot\ndo. No matter how strong or powerful the are, no matter how much\nInfluence they have, they cannot kill your soul.   This verse is\npoorly translated in the NIV. Their two different words used for\nkill.  </strong></p><p><strong>First\nword to kill the body is APOKTEIMO which means to slay. This word was\noften used to describe a violent death, to murder. or execute </strong></p><p><strong>Second\nword is APOLLUMI meaning to destroy means or to lose In the Greek\nlanguage if was often used to describe the loss of a father, a\nspouse, courage or life.\" The idea is not extinction but ruin,\nloss, not of being but of well being. to perish. This is clear from\nits use, as, e.g., of the marring of skins, Luke 5:37; of lost sheep,\ni.e., lost to the shepherd, metaphorical spiritual destitution, Luke\n15:4, 6, etc.; the lost son, 15:24; of the perishing of food, John\n6:27; of gold, 1 Pet. 1:7. of people, Matt. 2:13.</strong></p><p><strong>I\nthink, Jesus is saying that what a persons may suffer in their\nbodies, cannot take their life from them. The real you, your soul\ndoes not depend on you having a safe comfortable circumstances. No\nthe real you, your soul, gets it\u2019s life from God alone. </strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe look to safety and comfort as a source of life, then we will be\nmore open to fear. When our focus is on the protection and\npreservation of our bodies rather than being on the real person, the\nsoul, then we will be more open to fear and anxiety. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nour society it is difficult to see ourselves a people who live in\nbodies. The whole emphasis of this generation is more on the\npackaging than on the content. As Christians we need to keep in mind,\nthat what we are in the inside is far more important than what we are\non the outside and how we look, or what we can or can\u2019t do with our\nbodies.  </strong></p><p><strong>This\npreoccupation with the package is not only not spiritual, but it also\nencourages and produces the wrong kind of fear. We are not to fear\npeople and what they can do to us, rather we are to fear God. </strong></p><p><strong>This\nverse raises a number of other questions we need to look at. Why did\nJesus talk more about hell to Christians, than none Christians?  Is\nthe fear of hell different than the fear of God? </strong></p><p><strong>The\nfear of hell is presented more in the gospels has an incentive for\nholy living rather than an incentive for salvation. Why would the\nteaching of Jesus on hell, help people live a holy life?  Christians\nare the only people who appreciate what they have been saved from.\nKnowing what they have been saved from encourages them to pursue God\nand live holy lives.  Jesus does not say fear hell, but fear him the\none who can destroy both soul and body in hell.  </strong></p><p><strong>A\nhealthy fear of God will give us a right perspective on hell,\nhowever, a crippling fear of hell will produce in us an unhealthy\nconcept of God.  Often those who use hell as an evangelistic tool, to\nfear others into making a decision, that they do not understand.  \nThe more we know God, and understand his love, the more we will fear\nhell. Why, Because we realize that hell is the complete</strong><strong>\nantithesis to everything that is in the heart of God.</strong></p><p><strong>Experiencing\nthe love of God in our hearts, helps us appreciate how dreadful\nseparation from God is.   The Lord Jesus never uses fear of hell as\nan evangelistic tool because he knew that fear could never produces\nthe kind of commitment Christianity required. Also fear of hell will\nprevent repentance. </strong></p><p><strong>Knowing\nGod, or fearing God, and enjoying his love will produce in us a God\nlike attitude towards hell, we will want to live a righteous life so\nwe can become part of God's salvation purposes.</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>What\ndoes it mean to fear God, To fear God is to have a healthy reverence\nfor Him that will cause us to live such a life that we will be afraid\nof hurting God. This kind of fear is the deepest expression of love\nwe cane have for God. </strong></p><p><strong>Up\nto this point Jesus has addressed a number of fears. Fear</strong><strong>\nin relation to our integrity.</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u2018That which is hidden will be disclosed.\u2019 </strong></span><strong>Fear\nin relation to our circumstances. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2019What\nI tell you in the dark speak in the daylight.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nFear in relation to Jesus. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018What\nis whispered in your ear: proclaim from the rooftops.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n Fear in relation to man, ~</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Do\nnot fear those who can kill the body.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nAnd fear in relation to God, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018rather\nfear him who can destroy the body and soul in hell.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>Then\nJesus mentions one more fear. And in some ways this is the most\ncritical one for us to understand, for it is from this fear that all\nother unhealthy fears come. Fear in relation to ourselves, or the\nfear of insecurity.</strong></p><p><strong>5.\nTHOSE WHO </strong><strong>REALISE</strong><strong>\nTHAT GOD IS A CARING GOD WILL NOT FEAR. JESUS CONTINUES BY SAYING\n</strong><strong>Matthew\n10:29-30</strong><strong>\n</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Are\nnot two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to\nthe ground apart from the will of your Father.

In the previous verse Jesus was referring to the God who\ndestroys people in hell. Here he refers to the God who cares for the\nsparrow, and has the very hair on our heads numbered. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nway Jesus chooses to communicate God\u2019s care is very interesting. He\ndoes not talk in heavy theological language about the greatness of\nGod\u2019s glory. Rather he speaks about simple down to earth things,\neven things that are quite irrelevant to most people.  One of the\nreason why Jesus may have chosen to communicate God\u2019s care in this\nway is because when a person is full of unhealthy fear, they are\nunable to concentrate or think deeply, Jesus spoke in simple ways,\nuses simple illustrations, a fearful person could grasp. Jesus uses\nthe same principle in Matthew 6:28ff where he addresses the issue of\nworry.       </strong></p><p><strong>At\n\ta very surface level these passages together are teaching us that if\n\twe are going to cope with fear then we will need to have a whole\n\tview of God, we will need to know God for who he is.

    "html": "<p><strong>In\nverse 31 Jesus goes a bit deeper in helping us to realise how much\nGod cares for us. It is important that we know God cares for us, but\nit is not enough to know that God cares, we need to know why he\ncares. People can do caring things, and kind acts for lots of\ndifferent and sometimes wrong reasons. God wants to show us his care\nIn order to teach us about what is in his heart. God wants us to know\nthe authenticity of his care. He wants us to enjoy the act, by seeing\npast the act, and grasping the heart that motivated the caring act in\nthe first place. </strong></p><p><strong>So\nin verse 31 Jesus explains why God cares for us so much.  Knowing why\nGod cares is just as important as knowing that he does care. </strong></p><p><strong>Our\nview of God does not in any way effect God's care of us, however, our\nview of God does effect how we receive and respond to God's care. So\nit is only when we have a right and biblical view of God, will we be\nable to enjoy God's care. And his heart, which he wants to\ncommunicate to us, through his caring love. </strong></p><p><strong>THOSE\nWHO REALISE HOW VALUABLE THEY ARE TO GOD WILL RECEIVE HIS CARE, AND\nWILL HAVE NO REASON TO FEAR.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nconcludes is discussion on fear by saying </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cSo\ndo not fear, you are worth more than many sparrows.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nOften fear is related to a person\u2019s self-estimation, if a person is\nhas a low self-esteem they will be more prone to fear.  When Jesus\nspeaks of being worth more He uses the Greek word DIAPHERO. This is\nthe same word Paul uses in Philippians 1:10 The word means excellent.\nOr different, It was also used to carry something, Mark 11:16 or to\nspread the word of God, Acts 13:49, or superior Romans 2:18</strong></p><p><strong>So\nin God's estimation of us we are, excellent, we are worth choosing,\nwe are worth knowing. We are something precious that he wants to\ncarry, we are people God likes to talk about as a lover would talk\nabout the person they love. Our sin cannot change God's estimation of\nus. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nfear that is the consequences of feelings of worthlessness will drive\npeople to look for life and value in others things rather than God.\nIn some ways, the fear of worthlessness is the most dangerous fear of\nall, because it will motivate people away from God, looking for value\nin wrong places. </strong></p><p><strong>It\nis essential that we appreciate how much God values us, This\nappreciation of our worth to God will produce in us a confidence and\na security that will enable us to endure difficulties, which would\ncause others to fear.  </strong></p><p><strong>When\na person feels worthless, they will look for life and value in all\nthe wrong places, this in turn will increase their potential for\nliving a life full of fear. This feeling of being worthless will lead\nto a number of other negative emotions, like anger, bitterness, and\nthe inability to love others. Those who don't feel loved and valued\nwill find it hard to love and value others.  </strong></p><p><strong>In\nthe context of this chapter, we need to remember that Jesus is\nteaching about mission and the heart attitudes of those who are\ninvolved in mission. When a person who is involved in mission looses\na sense of their value to God, then the work our ministry will become\ntheir god, and they will look for life and value in it.</strong></p><p><strong>Those\nwho know that they are valuable to God will not fear loosing their\nministry.</strong></p><p><strong>Those\nwho know that they are valuable to God will never build their own\nkingdom.</strong></p><p><strong>Those\nwho know that they are valuable to God will hold onto their ministry\nwith a very loose hand.</strong></p><p><strong>Those\nwho know that they are valuable to God will pursue God, and will have\na hunger for him, because they will feel so secure, and that security\nwill increase their desire for God. </strong></p><p><strong>How\nwe handle fear is more important than the thing or the issue that may\nbe causing us to fear.</strong></p><p><strong>Those\n\twho have nothing to hide have nothing to fear.</strong></p><p><strong>Those\n\twho are listening in the dark have nothing to fear</strong></p><p><strong>Those\n\twho are enjoying intimacy with Jesus have nothing too fear.</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>Those\n\twho realise that their enemy has limitations will not fear.</strong></p><p><strong>Those\n\twho </strong><strong>realise</strong><strong>\n\tthat God is a caring God will not fear.</strong></p><p><strong>Those\n\twho realise how valuable they are to God will not fear.</strong></p><p><strong>These\nprinciples are not only the antidote for fear, but they are also the\nessentials for life.

But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown\nhim before my Father in heaven.</strong></span><strong>\n\u2018 </strong></p><p><strong>It\nwould be helpful to understand what Jesus means and doesn't mean when\nhe is speaking about </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"Whoever\nacknowledges me before men.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nWhen we think of the concept of acknowledging Jesus before men we\nautomatically think of being bold and courage. Having the courage to\nmake a public stance and telling people what you think of Jesus, not\nfearing what they will say. Although it is a good thing to make a\nstand for Jesus. And often we require strength and courage to do so. </strong></p><p><strong>This\nis not what Jesus is alluding to.  In fact, if we do not understand\nwhat Jesus is really saying here then we will not have the courage\nour strength to take a stand.   The word 'acknowledges' is the Greek\nword HOMOLOGGEO. The word means, \"To say the same as\" The\nword was often used as a legal term when one person agrees with an\nothers statement, concedes or confesses something. (E.g. his guilt\nbefore a judge.)  He agrees to i.e. a promise. </strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhen we 'acknowledge' Jesus before men, it is us saying the same kind\nof things Jesus would say. It more than talking about Jesus. It is an\nexpression of our fellowship with Jesus. Only those who are living in\nagreement with Jesus can acknowledge him before men. It should be a\nspontaneous expression of submission and fellowship rather than a\nlearned formula. </strong></p><p><strong>Every\ntime we resist the purposes of God in our lives, every time we refuse\nto let God have his way in our lives. Every time we are in\ndisagreement with God, then we cannot acknowledge him before men.  It\nis possible to speak about Jesus, even speak the truth about Jesus,\nand yet at the same time deny him, by not ministering to others out\nof fellowship. </strong></p><p><strong>The\ninteresting thing about this verse is that Jesus tells us that he\nwill acknowledge us before his father in heaven in the same way he\nwants us to acknowledge him before men on earth.  </strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus acknowledges us before his Father in heaven it is an expression\nof his fellowship with us. He is not like the court barrister who\npercent\u2019s cold facts to the judge with no emotional involvement.\nWhen Jesus acknowledges us before the father, he is speaking from his\nheart. His acknowledgement of us is an expression of his communion\nwith us.   Our fellowship on earth with Jesus effects Jesus'\nfellowship in heaven with his father.</strong></p><p><strong>DISOWNING\nJESUS.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\ncontinues </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018But\nwhoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in\nheaven.\u2019 </strong></span><strong>\nTo disown Jesus is the opposite of acknowledging Jesus.   If to\nacknowledge Jesus \"To say the same as\" or to be in\nfellowship with him, then to disown him is to be out of fellowship.\nYou can be in ministry and be out of fellowship with Jesus. You can\nbe saying the right things, doing the right things, and at the same\ntime disown Jesus, because what we are saying and doing is not an\nexpression of fellowship. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to look at this verse a bit deeper. We need to remember that\nJesus is speaking to those he is sending out in ministry. </strong></p><p><strong>The\ncontext clearly indicates that Jesus is speaking to his followers.\nFurther more the context of verses 33-32 are part of the chapter\nwhere Jesus is seeking to encourage his disciples.26ff.</strong></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\">\u2018<strong>But\nwhoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in\nheaven.\u2019 </strong></span><strong>The\nword for disown is ARNEOMAI. It means to contradict or reject. So is\nJesus saying that if we disown him, if we are out of fellowship with\nhim then we are lost? When the word is used in other New Testament\npassages, it rarely refers to a once and for all denial, or a\ncomplete walking away. For example it is used of Peter's denial of\nJesus. And the denial of Moses by the people of Israel in Egypt as he\nhad killed an Egyptian.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nmust remember that this passage is teaching about the motivation for\nministry, our fellowship with Jesus. It is not addressing the issue\nof the eternal security of the saint. ,</strong></p><p><strong>There\nis a similar passage in</strong></p><p><strong>2\nTim. 2:8-13</strong><strong>\nRemember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David.\nThis is my gospel, for which I am suffering even to the point of\nbeing chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained. \nTherefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they\ntoo may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal\nglory. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nPassage begins with Paul writing to Timothy about his (Paul's)\nministry and the difficulties he faced. Then he continues. </strong></p><p><strong>Here\nis a trustworthy saying:</strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe died with him, </strong></p><p><strong>we\nwill also live with him;  </strong></p><p><strong>if\nwe endure, </strong></p><p><strong>we\nwill also reign with him. </strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe disown him, </strong></p><p><strong>he\nwill also disown us;</strong></p><p><strong>Here\nwe have the very same word, and here Paul is speaking about  himself\nand Timothy. </strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe disown him he </strong></p><p><strong>will\ndisown us. Then he continues.</strong></p><p><strong>if\nwe are faithless, </strong></p><p><strong>he\nwill remain faithful, </strong></p><p><strong>for\nhe cannot disown himself.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nPaul's mind, being disowned is linked to God's faithfulness. So what\nare we saying?</strong></p><p><strong>If\nour fellowship with Jesus should be the basis and motivation for our\nministry, then we need to be aware that if we minister from any other\nbasis, then we are actually involved in denial. Often people have\nmany inappropriate and immoral motivations for ministry. Motivations\nlike guilt, pride, shame, anger, and the approval of others. All\nthese motivations will have the complete opposite effect than what\nthe person who is involved in ministry intended, they will produce no\nspiritual life, and will actually be denying Jesus</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nit is possible for me to say all  right things and still  disown you.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Psalms 110-113</p>",

Jesus himself said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"Blessed\nare the peace makers, they will be called Sons of God. </strong></span></p><p><strong>How\nare we to understand this tension?</strong></p><p><strong>When\na person makes a whole hatred commitment to Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>FALSE\nPEACE IS EXPOSED. </strong></p><p><strong>Jewish\nfamily life was very introverted and controlled. Appearance was\nimportant, and what you did for the family was how you measures your\nvalue to the family, and how you were perceived with in the family. \nThis way of thinking and living.  will always leads to a false peace.\nEverything appears to be going well to the outside world, but in\nreality relationships within the family are falling apart.  Often\nthis works its way out in a 'don\u2019t talk rule' which means people\nbury their hurt and pain, never dealing with what is going on in\ntheir hearts. In essence this peace has satanic characteristics\nbecause it built on deception, lies, and the refusal to be real.  \nHowever, when a family member becomes a follower of Jesus, their\nvalue system changes, and truth honesty and the issues of the heart\nbecame important. Two worlds clash under one roof.  Father may our\nfamilies be places where we can be real.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Psalm 114:1-118:9</p>",

      "Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: \u201cDo not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: \u2018The kingdom of heaven has come near. \u2019Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. \u201cDo not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts\u2014 no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. As you enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. \u201cI am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you \u201cBrother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. \u201cThe student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub. how much more the members of his household! \u201cSo do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father\u2019s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don\u2019t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. \u201cWhoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven. \u201cDo not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn \u201c\u2018 a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law\u2014a man\u2019s enemies will be the members of his own household.\u2019 \u201cAnyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. \u201cAnyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet\u2019s reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person\u2019s reward. And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.\u201d"

Sometimes people need to experience the\nsword, Sometimes speaking the truth, dealing with issues, has a\npiercing effect on people.

When Jesus speaks\nof turning family members against he other, he uses the word DICHAZO\nwhich mean to cut into two parts or cleave asunder. The word means to\nbe at variance with someone. So we need to ask, how should someone\nhandle such painful and traumatic relationships.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to stand back and remember that Jesus own family were at\nvariance with him, they thought he was mad, they did not believe him\nto be who he said he was. Jesus knew about the pain and stress caused\nby degenerating relationships within a family context. So how did\nJesus cope with such pressure.</strong></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\".\nAnyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of\nme.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n We need to remember that Jesus objective in life to was to bring\nglory to his father by taking up his cross. All through his life\nJesus had a heart posture that meant his life was heading to a death\non a cross. The heart attitudes Jesus required to go to the cross,\ndid not just appear during his last week on earth, no, those heart\nattitudes were always their. All through his life Jesus had taken up\nhis cross in his heart. </strong></p><p><strong>Think\nof some of the required heart attitudes Jesus would need if he was\ngoing to fulfil his father's will and go to the cross.</strong></p><p><strong>He\nwas able to take up his cross because his heart was full of love.</strong></p><p><strong>He\ndid not allow the injustice of his cruel death, to rob him of the\nfreedom to forgive. He knew that the pain of forgiving was consistent\nwith the character of God, and how his Father had designed life. He\nknew that to love your enemy invariably brings God Glory. He knew to\nexact vengeance by coming down from his cross would never meet the\ndeep needs of his own loving heart, or the demands of justice. He\nknew that only sacrificial expressions of radical love are the only\nway to reach the world with transforming grace.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nJesus had cross attitudes in his heart, all through his life, what a\ndifference that made in handling family hostility. Jesus was able to\nhandle the hostility of his own family because he knew he was going\nto the cross.  </strong></p><p><strong>The\nsame principle applies to our lives, If we are taking up our cross,\nnot as a rule, but because of love in our hearts, we will respond\nappropriately to kingdom conflict.  </strong></p><p><strong>Then\nJesus says </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018whoever\nfinds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake\nwill find it.\" </strong></span><strong>Finding\nand loosing life is tied up with our ability to take up our cross. In\nthe midst of great turmoil and hostility, a person can find life,\nwhen they have the heart attitudes of a cross carrier and they take\nup the cross. The heart attitudes that led Jesus to the cross are in\ntheir essence life finding attitudes. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus'\nconcept of finding life is both alternative and confrontational to\nhow most people perceive the finding of life to mean.  For Jesus the\nfinding of life included things like pain, suffering, and\nforgiveness, sacrifice even sorrow. For most of us, we equate the\nfinding of life with such things as peace, joy, comfort and a pain\nfree existence where all our needs are met. Most of us have fallen\nfor the lie, that we honestly believe that life is found in having a\ncomfortable care free life with no emotional stresses.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nGod made us he made us in his own image. He made us with the need to\nhave a cross-shaped life. He made us with a build in need to share\nthe same attitudes of the heart of Jesus, the attitudes that enabled\nand empowered Jesus to go to the cross are the same heart attitudes\nthat bring life to the full to every individual.</strong></p><p><strong>For\nJesus the most painful time of his life was also the time when he\nbrought his Father much glory. The shame of the cross did not rob\nJesus of his dignity or value. The cross did not belittle him or rob\nhim of life, rather the cross enabled Jesus to find and express life\nin all it's fullness, because he was expressing the heart of God in\nall it's glory. For Jesus, the cross was the ultimate expression of\nlife finding.    Finding life, and taking up the cross are\ninseparable. Life can't be found till the cross is carried, for in\ncaring our crosses we should be expressing the loving heart of God.\nIn expressing the loving heart of God, we are living to the full.  </strong></p><p><strong>SHARING\nMORE THAN A MESSAGE. MATTHEW 10:40-42  Jesus concludes his teaching\non ministry with these words, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"He\nwho receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one\nwho sent me.</strong></span><strong>\nBefore we consider what these words mean, we need to remind ourselves\nof the context of the chapter and the intention of Jesus in all this\nteaching.  </strong></p><p><strong>THE\nPURPOSE OF HIS TEACHING.  The whole purpose of Jesus teaching in this\nchapter is to give his disciples instructions and encouragement to\nprevent them from having a ministry that is both legalistic and\nbinding on people. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them,\nbecause they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a\nshepherd. The heart of Jesus wanted to set his people free. He wanted\nmore than anything to have is ministry of bringing freedom, to\ncontinue and progress through his disciples. </strong></p><p><strong>WHO\nHE IS TALKING TO.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsecond things we need to remind ourselves, is whom Jesus is\naddressing in these verses. Most people fall into the temptation of\nreading this verse. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"He\nwho receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one\nwho sent me.\"</strong></span><strong>\n Divorced from its context and apply it to all Christian, in all\nplaces, and at all times. So we read </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"He\nwho receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one\nwho sent me.\"</strong></span><strong>\nAnd we assume that this is always the case, that when someone\nreceives us, they also receive Jesus. But if we were honest, we have\nall have people who have shown us a measure of acceptance, but they\nseem to have no spiritual interest or indication that they have\nreceived Jesus also.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nverse is furthered complicated by the fact that Jesus as been\nteaching all through the chapter that many people would reject both\nthem and the message they were bringing. So what does theses verses\nmean? </strong></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"He\nwho receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one\nwho sent me. \u2018</strong></span></p><p><strong>Those\n\twho have understood the teaching of Jesus up to this point will\n\tbring more than the message of the gospel, they will bring the Jesus\n\tof the gospel.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nhave worked through this chapter, we have learned many lessons,\nlessons that will hopefully shape our characters as well as our\nministry. If we begin to have lives that have been so shaped by the\ninstructions of Jesus in this chapter. Remember the Greek word for\ninstructions is Parangello, used by all kinds of authorities. A\nmilitary term used to describe an order giving by a commanding\nofficer. It was an order that required unhesitating and unqualified\nobedience.  It was a word used to describe an official court summons.\n It was used to describe a moral obligation. It was also used to\ndescribe a prescription from a doctor. So what Jesus is going to say\nhere to these men is not merely some good ideas he has thought of,\nthey are command, they are things he demands of us. If the lessons of\nthis chapter become real, then the YOU that people receive will be\nmuch more that a person with a message, they will be someone who is\nfull of the life of Jesus. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"He\nwho receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one\nwho sent me.\u2019 </strong></span></p><p><strong>The\nimplication of this verse is quite staggering. People need to receive\nmore than the message of the Gospel, they need to receive Jesus also,\nour they need to hear more than words that we might say, they also\nneed to see Jesus, the source of our lives in us.  There is an\nindissoluble link between our lives and the lives of Jesus.  The\nworld has no other way of seeing the reality of the life of Jesus\nexcept through us. So the YOU that Jesus is addressing in this verse\nis not the professional career missionary who is totally committed to\nthe work of mission, The YOU of this verse, are those who have found\nJesus to be their only source of life, and only reason for living. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nmust not misunderstand what Jesus is saying here, He is not giving a\nguarantee that people will receive the YOU of this verse. Most of the\nchapter has be telling us that reject is more probable than being\nreceived. But when people do receive us, they are also receiving\nJesus.</strong></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\">\u2018</span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>Anyone\nwho receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a\nprophet's reward, and anyone who receives a righteous man because he\nis a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.  </strong></span></p><p><strong>In\nthis passage Jesus uses two different words for receive, In verse 40\nthe word dechomai is used this word carries the idea of off accepting\nor receiving letters or presents. It also means to hear with\nunderstanding or to show hospitality.  It is a passive word,\nindicating that something is offered not forced. The second word for\nin verse 41 is a much stronger word. Lambano, this word means to\nseize, to take hold of something, for example we speak of someone\nbeing seized with fear So what is Jesus saying. We have two choices\nwhen it comes to reaching other people. We can either go to others\nwith the life of Jesus so </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\"He\nwho receives you receives me,</strong></span><strong>\nor we go to people on the basis of our ministry and integrity.\n</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Anyone\nwho receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a\nprophet's reward, and anyone who receives a righteous man because he\nis a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.</strong></span><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe go to others, because we have a ministry, or because we believe it\nis the right thing to do, then our hold approach will be different. \nWe will have to use our strength and power to get people to receive\nsomething. Because we are going on the strength of our ministry and\nintegrity we could assume that this is a good basis for people to\nreceive our ministry. However, going on this basis will require that\nwe will have to Lambano the person and not dechomai the person.</strong></p><p><strong>Ministry,\ngifts and integrity are very important, but they are not enough,\nJesus says that if we go on the basis of our ministry, a prophet, or\nif we go on the basis of or integrity,  a righteous man, people will\nbe blessed, people will receive a reward, but the YOU of verse 40\nwill not only bring a reward to people, they will bring Jesus to\npeople. </strong></p><p><strong>It\nis so easy to base or ministry on the gifts God has kindly given us,\nand it is so easy to assume that because we are perceived as people\nof integrity, then we must be bringing the life of Jesus to people.\nSo in order to prevent us from relying on the gift we have received\nand developed. Instead of relying on our reputations and others\nperceptions of us as righteous we need to become the YOU of verse 40,\nhow? </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nconcludes this teaching in a most wonderful and profound way.  He\nsays </strong><strong>Matthew\n10:42 </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2019And\nif anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones\nbecause he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly\nnot lose his reward.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n We need to go to people not in the strength of our prophetic\nministry, or any other gifting. We need to go to people not in the\nstrength of our integrity, although that is very important. Rather we\nneed to go to people in the weakness of one of the \u2018little ones. \u2018</strong></p><p><strong>Being\na vulnerable \u2018little one,\u2019 has more influence than any prophetic\ngift, our any strong integrity.

God will bless people through\nthe usage of our gifts, and people of integrity are indispensable.\nBut it is through the little ones, the YOU of verse 40 that the\nkingdom comes with the reality of the life of Christ. </strong></p><p><strong>After\nJesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from\nthere to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.

In reading this story it is\nvery easy to go down the lines of identifying with one of the\nsisters. Some feel that they can identify more with Martha than with\nMary, these people would see themselves as being practical, they are\nthe kind of people who are not afraid to get their hands dirty, like\nthe Samaritan in the previous parable they are eager to respond to\nthe practical needs of others. However there are others like Mary,\nwho is more devotional than practical, they are deep thinkers; people\nwho like to sit at Jesus\u2019 feet, they like to read and hold\ntheological discussions. However, to approach the text in this way is\nto miss the point. Luke is not trying to set up one kind of service\nagainst another. The issue that Luke is addressing is much deeper\nthan the type of service we offer; rather he is addressing the heart\nbehind the service.</strong></p><p><strong>The\ninitial welcome</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>As\nJesus and his disciples went on their way, he came to a certain\nvillage where a woman named Martha opened her house to him.\u2019  As we\nbegin to look at this incident we need to remember that in bible\ntimes, hospitality was very important. In the ancient world the\npractice of hospitality meant to graciously receive a stranger into\none's land, home, or community and provide directly for that person's\nneeds. In the ancient world hospitality was nothing like today\u2019s\nimage of good hospitality. Because people travelled by foot, journeys\ntook a long time therefore travellers depended on the hospitality of\nothers to help them on their way. Middle Eastern hospitality would\nhave included</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>the\noffering of a meal consisting of a number of different dishes from\nwhich guests could select.

Martha\u2019s mind\nand emotions were all over the place.  The word was also used for a\nwoman with a sad expression on her face. She was too preoccupied with\nbeing a good host and this was leading to an attitude that was\nentirely unhelpful. At this point Martha\u2019s was loosing perspective.\nThe things that she was doing had begun to take control of her. Her\nduties had begun to dictate her feelings, affections and thoughts\ntoward herself and others.  </strong></p><p><strong>Before\nwe leave this point we should mention that sometimes people use their\nservice for Jesus as a form of avoidance mechanism, they don\u2019t want\nto deal with the issues of their own hearts, so they mistakenly think\nthat if they are busy serving Jesus they must be okay. What we do for\nJesus will mean very little to him, if anything, if we are refusing\nto face up to and deal with the issues that are going on inside us. </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that both Mary\u2019s and Martha\u2019s service was important to\nyou</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Psalms 119:41-96</p>",

It is as if Martha feels a need to stand up for herself, so she bursts into the room totally exasperated with Jesus and Mary, she is frustrated and angry, and says, \u2018Lord don\u2019t you care?\u2019She begins to think wrongly about Jesus. \u2018Lord don\u2019t you care?\u2019 At this time she is viewing Jesus as someone who is unconcerned about her and what she is feeling. When we stop believing that Jesus cares, we start to lash out at others. When Martha says, \u201cLord, don\u2019t you care?\u201d she really means to say, \u201cLord, you don\u2019t care at all because if you did, you would have told Mary to go to the kitchen and help me.\u201d Martha is feeling neglected and abandoned by Jesus however, although she was feeling this way, her feelings were not communicating the truth."

As Christians we need to be continually\nchoosing to completely orientate the whole of our lives around the\nreality of the person and presence of Jesus. We need to be\ncontinually curious about him. We need to be continually teachable,\nalways learning new things about him.  need to continually long for a\ndeeper and better relationship with him. We need to develop a core\nbelief that Jesus is an absolute necessary part of us if we are going\nto function properly as a human beings in our everyday lives. So to\nhelp us love, know and follow Jesus, we want to look at Jesus\u2019\nrelationship with the Holy Spirit, and how this relationship affected\nhis every day life, and what Jesus taught about the Spirit. But let\nus start with three important foundation principles:-</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nJesus\u2019 relationship with the Holy Spirit helps us understand who\nJesus is.</strong></p><p><strong>As\na man, Jesus lived a life that needed the work of the Holy Spirit. He\ndid what he did, not because he was God incarnate, but because he was\nsubmitted and filled with the Holy Spirit. The person Jesus became,\nthe work Jesus did and the example Jesus is, was because of his\nrelationship with the Holy Spirit.</strong></p><p><strong>Peter\nsaid  \u2018</strong><strong>You\nknow\u2026 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth </strong><em><strong>with\nthe Holy Spirit and power</strong></em><strong>,\nand how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the\npower of the devil, because God was with him.\u2019 (Acts 10:37-38)</strong></p><p><strong>It\nwould be very easy for us to think that Jesus did all his great works\nbecause he was fully God, and was working out if his Devine nature.\nIn Philippians 2, Paul says that \u201cthough he was in the form of God,\n[he] did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made\nhimself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the\nlikeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by\nbecoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross\u201d (v\n6-8). </strong></p><p><strong>Paul\nis not saying that the eternal Son of God gave up or surrendered any\nattributes of deity. Jesus \u201cmade himself nothing\u201d or \u201cemptied\u201d\nhimself by becoming a man, not by ceasing to be God. Thus, in\nbecoming a human being, \u201cthe Son of God willed to renounce the\nexercise of his divine powers, attributes, prerogatives, so that he\nmight live fully within those limitations which inhere in being truly\nhuman.\u201d (Gerald Hawthorne, </strong><em><strong>The\nPresence &amp; the Power</strong></em><strong>,\n208). He willingly chose not to use his Devine power. In Jesus, we\nsee a human being doing super-human things and ask \u201cHow?\u201d </strong></p><p><strong>The\nanswer is: Not from the power of his own divine nature, but through\nthe power of the Holy Spirit. For Jesus, his miraculous demonstration\nof his power was because he was anointed with the Spirit.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nfact, Jesus himself said that his ministry was because he was\nanointed with the Holy Spirit. </strong></p><p><strong>Luke\n4:16-19 \u2018When he came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home,\nhe went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read\nthe Scriptures.

As a man, Jesus\nlived the life he lived, not because he had a divine nature but\nbecause he was predominantly dependant on the Holy Spirit. As a man,\nhe chose to live a life that required the empowering of the Holy\nSpirit. On occasions, Jesus did display aspects of his divine nature,\nfor example when he was transfigured, or when he forgave sin, for\nonly God can forgive sin; but for the most part, Jesus lived as an\nordinary man who had a life that was empowered by the Holy Spirit.</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>The\nHoly Spirit was the divine power by which Jesus overcame his human\nlimitations [such as being limited in knowledge and bound by physical\nspace and human strength], rose above his human weakness, and won out\nover his human mortality.\u201d</strong><strong>\nGerald Hawthorne.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nJesus was to use his Devine power and authority as a man, he would\nhave ceased to be truly human, that is why he choose a life of\ndependence on the Holy Spirit.  </strong></p><p><strong>You\ncould say that Jesus\u2019 humanity was defined by his continually\ndependence upon the Holy Spirit.</strong></p><p><strong>The\n\t\t\tSpirit was active in Jesus\u2019 birth.</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>The\nHoly Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will\novershadow you.

Jesus demonstrated clearly that God\u2019s\nintended way for human beings to live, the ideal way to live, the\nsupremely successful way to live, is in conjunction with God, in\nharmony with God, in touch with the power of God, and not apart from\nGod, not independent of God, not without God. The Spirit was the\npresence and power of God in Jesus, and fully so.\u201d (234)  Gerald\nHawthorne</strong></p><p><strong>As\nwe look at Jesus\u2019 relationship with the Holy Spirit we are going to\ndiscover that life in the Spirit is not some kind of mystical,\nethereal, subjective experience that produces a spiritual high.

Or you could put it another way by saying, that nobody\ncan be who they are really meant to be, without the continual work of\nthe Spirit in their lives. Living life in the Spirit gives us an\nopportunity to be ourselves, to embrace and enjoy our humanity as God\nintended.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to develop a theological and biblical anthropology, anthropology\nbeing the study of what makes us human. I believe, that only when we\ncome to the realisation that we have been made by God and made for\nGod, will we be able to understand our humanness. Our lives and\nbody's have been bespokely designed to accommodate the person and\nwork of the Spirit. Maybe seeing our humanity as something that needs\nto be an expression of a Spirit filled life, would/could/should\nchange our understanding of the fruit and gifts of the Spirit. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nfruit of the Spirit is far more than replacements for the works of\nthe flesh.

The nativity story is recorded both in Matthew and Luke,\nand if you were to compare them you will notice that they are very\ndifferent. The reason for this is because each writer is telling the\nsame story but from a different perspective. Matthew is telling the\nStory from Joseph\u2019s perspective, while Luke is telling it from\nMary\u2019s perspective. However despite the difference in perspective\nand content they are both in agreement about the role of Holy Spirit\nin the conception. They both record that an angelic being told Mary\nthat she would conceive by the power of the Holy Spirit. </strong></p><p><strong>Luke\ntells us that Gabriel spoke to Mary.  \u2018Mary asked the angel, \u201cBut\nhow can this happen? I am a virgin.\u201dThe angel replied, \u201cThe Holy\nSpirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will\novershadow you. So the baby to be born will be holy, and he will be\ncalled the Son of God.\u2019 1:34-35.</strong></p><p><strong>Matthew\ntells us that the angel of the Lord spoke to Joseph. \u2018As he\nconsidered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream.\n\u201cJoseph, son of David,\u201d the angel said, \u201cdo not be afraid to\ntake Mary as your wife. For the child within her was conceived by the\nHoly Spirit.\u2019  Matthew 1:20</strong></p><p><strong>I\nthink we need to consider the significance of this. The same message\nabout the role of the Holy Spirit is delivered twice by an angelic\nbeing to two different people at two different times. </strong></p><p><strong>There\nmay be a number of reasons why we are not too inclined to consider\nthe role of the Holy Spirit in the birth narrative of Jesus.<br/>\n</strong><br/></p><p><strong>1.\nWe find it easier to relate to the human characters of the story.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nare familiar with Mary and Joseph, we know their backstory, we know\nthat she is probably a young teenager who scandalously conceived\noutside the legitimate confines of marriage.  We know that because\nJoseph was a righteous man he was unsure as to what he should do.\nShould he divorce her? Divorce being the only way of nullifying the\nbetrothal covenant. <br/>\nThis is a drama, a story that catches our\nimagination and pulls on our emotions. We are slow to recognise that\nthe Holy Spirit is there working in the background, making things\nhappen, we might consider him playing a vital role, but we would not\nsee him as one of the main characters.       </strong></p><p><strong>Maybe\nthe uniqueness of this event causes us to overlook the role of the\nSpirit in this situation.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nall know that there will never be an other miraculous conception.\nWhat the Holy Spirit did in the life of Mary was an abnormal one off\nevent. However, although the work of the Spirit in Mary was unique\nand unrepeated, the character of the Holy Spirit, the principles by\nwhich he works and goal or objective he has [to produce in us the\nreality of Jesus,] are the same.  Our lives need to become an echo of\nthe nativity, where Jesus is formed in us and revealed through us.\nLet\u2019s be honest we would rather watch the nativity as a sanitised\nchildren\u2019s play than be part of it, however, we all need our own\npersonalised \u2018nativity\u2019 story.. Our lives need to become an echo\nof the original nativity.</strong></p><p><strong>A\nthird possible reason why we may ignore the role of the Holy Spirit\nin the nativity is we may assume that Mary\u2019s and Joseph's\nunderstanding of who the Holy Spirit is the same or similar to our\nunderstanding of the Spirit. So when we read \u2018The Holy Spirit will\ncome upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you,\u2019\nwe must not assume that Mary understood it as we do.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to keep in mind that Mary and Joseph lived at a time when\nRabbinic teaching was prevalent.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>For\ncenturies according to many of the rabbis, those teachers who most\ninfluenced the thinking of the first century Palestinian Judaism, the\nSpirit had been silent, his work was over and his activity was a past\nphenomenon.  The Spirit had indeed given Israel the Torah, lots\nprophets and the whole of its scriptures, but having done that, his\nwork has ceased.\u2019 Gerald Hawthorne.</strong></p><p><strong>It\nwas a common belief that the Holy Spirit had departed from Israel and\nno-one had the Spirit. So when the angel declared that Mary would\nconceive by the power of the Holy Spirit, he was telling Mary that\nher experience of God would be outside her understanding. Sometimes\nGod will do things in our lives that may appear to be outside the\nnormal or the usual. Sadly this fact can lead to people doing things\nthat are either ridiculous, selfish, dangerous our immoral. The Holy\nSpirit is called the Holy Spirit, and he will never ask anyone to act\noutside the moral will of God. He will never resort to sin, deceit or\nabusive manipulation to accomplish the will of the father in your\nlife or the lives of others There was absolutely no immorality in\nMary\u2019s conception outside marriage. </strong></p><p>Father\nThank you that the work of the Spirit may be unusual but will never\nbe immoral or egotistical.</p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Psalm 148:7-150:6  proverbs 11-2:9</p>",

He may ask of us things that could cause us to\nfeel inadequate and overwhelmed, so we will cultivate a dependence on\nthe Spirit. </strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme point a number of lessons from the work of the Spirit in the life\nof Mary.</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nThere will be glory and pain of the work of the Spirit in our lives.\nThe nativity story teaches us that the work of the Spirit in our\nlives is glorious and painful at the same time. What could be more\nglorious for Mary to have the life of Jesus formed in her.  </strong></p><p><strong>Listen\nto these words:-</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>The\nWord became flesh! God became human! The invisible became visible!\nThe untouchable became touchable! Eternal life experienced temporal\ndeath! The transcendent one, descended and drew near! The unlimited\nbecame limited! The infinite</strong><strong><strong>\n</strong></strong><strong>became\nfinite! The immutable became mutable! The unbreakable became fragile!\nSpirit became matter! Eternity entered time! The independent became\ndependent! The almighty became weak! The loved became hated! The\nexalted was humbled! Glory was subjected to shame! Fame turned into\nobscurity! From inexpressible joy to tears of unimaginable grief!\nFrom a throne to a cross! From ruler to being ruled! From power to\nweakness!\u2019  Sam Storms</strong></p><p><strong>Think\nabout how amazing, how wonderful, how fantastic,  how glorious, how\nmarvellous, how spectacular, how awesome, how astonishing and how\nsensational the Holy Spirit wants to produce in us the life of Jesus.\nThe incarnation of Jesus is continued through his body, the church.\nThe incarnate Jesus continues to express himself through the\ntransforming power of the Holy Spirit in us. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nglorious work of the Spirit in a persons life will never make them\nimmune to pain, suffering or paying a high price to follow Jesus.\nSometimes in the modern church, living in the Spirit can be presented\nas a panacea to all of life\u2019s woes. We are inclined to think that\nif we are submitted fully to God, life might be easier or better. The\nlife of Jesus teaches us, as does the life of Mary that although\nliving a Spirit life is wonderful, it is also challenging, complex,\nand at times very isolating. </strong></p><p><strong>Mary\nwas a young girl between the age of 12-15 who was betrothed to a man\ncalled Joseph. Betrothal was a legally binding covenant that could\nonly be dissolved by divorce.   During this time the man and his\nbride lived apart. He stayed at his father\u2019s home, where he would\nextend his father\u2019s home in preparation for bringing his bride\nhome. Add to the pressure, conception during the betrothal period\nwhich was considered an act of adultery and could be punishable by\ndeath. You could say that Gabriel's announcement trashed Mary\u2019s\nhopes, dreams and plans. In obeying God, Mary would have been\nmisjudged and wrongly perceived as shameful. The bible gives us no\nindication as to how Mary may have viewed the dramatic change and\ninterruption to her plans, but we can be sure that she would have\nfelt unprepared for such a dramatic turn of events. She did not ask\nfor or seek this role in God\u2019s plans; God has simply stepped into\nher life and brought her into his service.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nare two important things I want to say about this.</strong></p><p><strong>At\ntheir essence most of the plans we make, especially life changing\nplans, like getting married, getting a job, changing direction in\nlife are emotionally based decisions. They are more than cold facts\nwritten on a white board, and for the most part they come from an\nemotional place, and are full of emotional expectations. So when\nGod\u2019s will begins to threaten our hopes and plans we really\nstruggle. We struggle because we are not unemotional robots, we\nstruggle because our hopes for the future have caused us to become\nexcited about our plans. This is what you could call \u2018 the nativity\nstruggle.\u2019 </strong></p><p><strong>Have\nyou ever thought that Mary could have said no, just as much as we\nhave the freedom to say yes?  There will be times in our lives when\nwe will have to engage in \u2018the nativity struggle.\u2019 when we will\nhave to decide, do I want to do life my way, or God\u2019s way? When we\nhave to decide if God\u2019s eternal purposes are more important than\nour temporary agenda.</strong></p><p><strong>Also\nwe need to come to a heart conviction that it is better to live a\ndifficult, complex life within the will of God, than to life in the\nsafe monotony of my own existence. There were lots of reasons why\nMary could have said no, she could have played it safe, but she had\nthe courage to see beyond the boundaries of her emotional safe plans\nand her obscurity, and choose the difficult path because it was the\nbest. \u2018The Nativity struggle\u2019 is having the courage not play it\nsafe. \u2018The Nativity struggle\u2019 is to let encounters with God\ndetermine the course of your life so His Son can be formed in you. </strong></p><p><strong>But\nnot only is Mary going to know the pain of the life of the Spirit but\nshe is also going to know the glory of the Spirits work in her life.\nWhen she asked the angel \u2018How can this happen, the angel replied,\n\u2019The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High\nwill overshadow you.\u2019 The word for overshadow is episkiazo which is\nused four times in the Greek translation of the Old Testament. When\nGod overshadowed the tabernacle with his presence see Exodus 40:35.\nIn Psalm 91:4 the same word is used to describe how God [protectively\ncovers his people. The other two uses Psalm 140:7 and Proverbs 18:11.\nboth these verses use the word to describe a means of protection..</strong></p><p><strong>For\nMary the work of the Holy Spirit in her life did not protect her from\nthe painful realities of living a life for God, rather it protected\nher in the painful realities of living for God.   </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that the Holy Spirit protects us in the in the painful\nrealities of living for God not from those painful realities.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> proverbs 2:10-5:14</p>",

Around Nazareth there\nwere many abandoned quarries that were ideal for landfill. Into these\nquarries the carcasses of dead animals and other refuse was placed.\nBecause of the high level of lead contamination and bacteria\nputrefaction caused by the garbage dumps, Nazareth became synonymous\nwith physical and mental illness. Nazareth became a derogatory slang\nword for anything that was despicable, dirty or diseased.        </strong></p><p><strong>The\nNativity story teaches us, that in our obscurity and isolation we\nneed an encounter with God.

We need to ask God to meet us in bleakness of our\nobscurity and realise that prestige, position and power are never\nnecessary for the purposes of God to be accomplished in our lives.  \nOur social, economic, environmental or geographical status does not\ndetermine the purposes of God for our lives. The critical factor for\nanyone who wants to see God\u2019s will accomplished in them, is their\nrelationship with the Holy Spirit.  Submission is more important than\nopportunity. D L Moody said, \u201cThe world has yet to see what God can\ndo with a man fully consecrated to him. By God\u2019s help, I aim to be\nthat man.\u201d  </strong></p><p><strong>Mary\nwas seemingly a nobody from a despised placed, but because of her\nsubmission to God and His Spirit, the world was transformed.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nwork of the Holy Spirit in our lives needs to sanctify the ordinary.</strong></p><p><strong>After\nthe angel Gabriel came to Mary, everything in her world changed. The\nfuture would be very different than she could have ever imagined,\nhowever, on the other hand nothing changed.  Mary remained where she\nwas, her daily life was not radically changed.

We don\u2019t read of any more angelic\nvisits, or special revelations, except when John leaped for joy in\nhis mother\u2019s womb. Luke 1:41.</strong></p><p><strong>It\nwas in the mundane ordinariness of the every day that God found the\nspace to grow Mary and the life of Jesus within her. God could have\nset Mary in some luxurious palace where she could had been waited on\nand had all her needs met, but he didn\u2019t. Mary, full of the life of\nJesus through the power of the Spirit had to grow in the dim\nrealities of her normal obscure life.  Something in me thinks that\nGod loves to turn the ordinariness of our lives into a holy space.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nwork of the Holy Spirit in our lives will challenge how we think\nabout ourselves so we can receive God\u2019s love. </strong><strong>What\nI find fascinating about Mary is the thing that caused her to be\nconfused and disturbed.  Look at what the text says, \u2018Gabriel\nappeared to her and said, \u201cGreetings, favoured woman! The Lord is\nwith you!. Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel\ncould mean.  The word Luke uses for disturbed \u201cdiatarasso\u201d meant\n\u201cagitate\u201d perplexed,\u201d \u201cgreatly troubled.\u201d  The appearance\nof the angel Gabriel did not disturb her, but what he said about her.\n</strong></p><p><strong>What\nis going on here?

But let me remind you of the words of Jesus. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Many\nwill say to me on that day, \u2018Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in\nyour name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform\nmany miracles?\u2019 \u2018Then I will tell them plainly, \u2018I never knew\nyou. Away from me, you evildoers!\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nMatthew 7;22-23</strong></p><p><strong>As\nwe are going to see from the life of Jesus, the role of the Holy\nSpirit in our lives is to help us accept that we are children of God.\nPaul said it this way in Romans 8:15-16 \u2019So you have not received a\nspirit that makes you fearful slaves. Instead, you received God\u2019s\nSpirit when he adopted you as his own children. Now we call him,\n\u201cAbba, Father. For his Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that\nwe are God\u2019s children.\u2019 </strong></p><p><strong>We\nneed to get our minds around this. As it was for Jesus so it needs to\nbe for us. The primary work of the Spirit is to help us find our\nidentity in the Father\u2019s love. I do not hear many people pray about\nthis. We are happy to rightly ask the Spirit to help us in our\nministry, or to work in the lives of others, but rarely do we seek\nthe Spirit\u2019s help when it comes to discovering and accepting who we\nare. And yet identity rooted in the love of the Father, through the\nwork of the Spirit, needs to be the place from where our lives and\nministry come from.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nknow that Jesus did his ministry through the power of the Spirit see\nActs 10:38. Luke 4:18. But this power of the Spirit for ministry was\nan expression of him knowing his Fathers love. He did what he did in\nministry not only because he knew that his father loves us, but\nbecause he also knew that the father loved him.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nwas no identity crisis in the life of Jesus Christ. He knew who He\nwas. He knew where He had come from, and why he was here. And he knew\nwhere He was going. And when you are that liberated, then you can\nserve.\u2019 Howard Hendricks.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nHoly Spirit at the Baptism of Jesus</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nLet\u2019s consider the heart attitude as Jesus got baptised</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>a.\nHumility.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nwent to John to be baptized. This is very strange because John was\nbaptizing people because they were turning from their sin and turning\nto God. See Matthew 3:1-12. We know that Jesus had lived a life free\nfrom sin, he lived a life in continual fellowship with his Father, so\nwhy did he want John to baptize him? He chose to be baptized so he\ncould humbly identify with us. His baptism was an expression of\nprofound humility and radical identification. You could say that in\nsome ways the humility and identification that Jesus expressed in his\nbaptism was a shadow of the humility and identification he would show\nat the cross. Jesus would be unable to accomplish his father\u2019s will\nwithout living a life of continual humility. His humility enabled him\nto meaningfully relate to every broken and needy person he met. </strong></p><p><strong>b.\nPrayer.</strong></p><p><strong>Luke\ntells us, \u2018As he was praying the heavens opened.\u2019 we do not know\nwhat Jesus prayed for, but there may be a clue in the text.  In\nMark\u2019s account of the Baptism of Jesus we are told a very\ninteresting thing. He says that the heavens were torn open. The word\nfor torn is </strong><em><strong>schizomenous,\nthis is a violent word that means to tear or cleave and it requires\ndetermination and strength. The same word is used in Mark 15:38\ntalking about the curtain in the temple being torn in two. \n(Apparently the temple curtain was so heavy that it took 300 men to\nlift it.) When Mark tells us the heavens were torn open, he was\nalluding to a passage in the Old Testament, Isaiah 64:1-4</strong></em></p><p><em>\u2018<strong>Oh,\nthat you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains\nwould tremble before you! 2 As when fire sets twigs ablaze and causes\nwater to boil, come down to make your name known to your enemies and\ncause the nations to quake before you! 3 or when you did awesome\nthings that we did not expect, you came down, and the mountains\ntrembled before you. 4 Since ancient times no one has heard, no ear\nhas perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who acts on\nbehalf of those who wait for him.\u2019 </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Isaiah\n64:1-4 is part of a longer prayer of lament recorded in Isaiah\n63:7-64:12. A lament is a prayer that cries out to God from the midst\nof desperate grief, pain, or any circumstance that seems out of\ncontrol. It vocalizes the hurt to God with the conviction, the faith,\nthat God can and will bring relief. A lament is not just the venting\nof frustration, but is a profound statement of faith in God from the\nmidst of utter human hopelessness. The significance of a lament is\nthat the worshipper prays in the midst of his pain. He believes that\nGod cares about His condition and he has enough faith in God to trust\nHim with the outcome. It is interesting to note that the prayer\nrecorded in Isaiah 64:1-4 is that God would rend the heavens, come\ndown and make your name know to your enemies by great displays of\npower causing the mountains to tremble.  However, when God tore open\nthe heavens, his power and glory were not displayed in the way the\nprayer in Isaiah had hoped or expected. Their was no powerful display\nof God\u2019s just wrath, but a display of the tender love of a father.</strong></em></p><p><strong>Father\nmay the powerful affirming ministry of the Spirit continually touch\nmy life.  </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> proverbs 8:12-11:11</p>",

See Exodus 23:30 Deuteronomy 33:27ff. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>We\nare not told how the Spirit did this.

God was sending his son into the wilderness with a strong\npassion so he could confront and unmask the evil one. This is very\nimportant. Most people understand the temptation of Jesus as a\nresponse of Satan to the baptism of Jesus. But I think it is more\nlikely that God, by the power and leading of the Holy Spirit was\ntaking the battle to Satan through his Son. Jesus\u2019 anointing and\naffirmation at his baptism made him \u2018battle ready.\u2019 He went into\nthe enemies\u2019 territory not just to learn how to be a faithful son\nwho was confined to the limitations of a human body, but he also\nexposed the subtle ways of Satan through his absolute faithfulness. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>It\nis interesting that Mark 1:12 uses the word ekballo for Jesus being\nled/driven into the wilderness, because Mark had a positive\nunderstanding of spiritual warfare. There are four major exorcism\nstories in Mark, Mark 1:21-28, 5:1-20, 7:24-30, 9;14-29. Three of\nthese stories have a common denominator, in 1:21-28, 5:1-20 and\n9:14-29 Jesus went to where the demon was, he invaded their\nterritory, He took the initiative. What he learned in the wilderness\nhe continued to practice. According to Matthew 12:28 Jesus cast\ndemons out by the Spirit of God.</strong></em></p><p><strong><strong>When\nwe compare what Luke tells us about Jesus being led by the Spirit\ninto the wilderness at this time, with what Mark says, there is a\nslight but important difference  in emphasis. Mark\u2019s emphasis is\n\u2018The Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness,\u2019 while Luke\u2019s\nemphasis is \u2018The Spirit led Jesus in[not into, but in,] the\nwilderness.\u2019 T</strong></strong><strong><strong>he\nword Luke uses to describe the Spirit leading Jesus in the wilderness\n\u2018ago\u2019, almost means the complete opposite to Ekballo, it has the\nidea to carry, to bring,  to guide. and to keep leading. So as Jesus\nwas fasting and was being tempted for forty days he continued to be\nled by the Spirit. This leading of the Spirit in the wilderness\nsustained Jesus in this hostile environment. If we sat back and think\nabout this it would have a life giving effect upon our lives. There\ncould have been a lot of things God the Father could have done to\nhelp his Son. He could have changed Jesus\u2019 circumstance, he could\nhave miraculously provided sustenance but he didn\u2019t. Instead, Jesus\nexpressed continual submission in a time of great testing so he could\nremain faithful in his humanity because off the leading of the\nSpirit.

As he was being led by the Spirit in the\nwilderness his mind was saturated with the word of God.  </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>2.\nHe was self controlled.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>This\nwas a physically challenging time for Jesus, he was hungry and tired,\nliving with unmet needs, but through the leading of the Spirit he\nchose not to take things into his own hands. Through the leading and\npower of the Spirit he was able to keep his human desires in check,\nrefusing to use his divine power to provide comfort or ease.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>3.\nHe trusted his Father.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>As\nwe have said, Jesus had divine power, and with a word he could have\nturned this wilderness into Eden. But he did not use his divine\npower, he did not play his \u2018God card.\u2019  He valued submission\nabove power or ability,  because he understood that being submitted\nto the will of God, was more important than having genuine needs met.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>This\nis both amazing and extremely relevant. Here was Jesus, the creator\nof the universe. The one who created all things by the power of his\nword. But in his humanity he chose to set aside his divine power and\nability, and instead he chose to submit himself to the leading of the\nSpirit. It is incredible to think that Jesus defeated Satan from the\nposture of submission not one of power or strength. It was through\nsubmission that he had the emotional and mental resolve to contend\nwith the powers of darkness.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Like\nJesus we need to learn what it means to be led by the Spirit,\nespecially at times of isolation and temptation. Maybe it is at these\ntimes, when we feel extremely vulnerable or weak that our need to be\nled by the Spirit is even grater. Maybe it is in </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>the\ngrit of our personal wildernesses that we learn what it means to be\nled by the Spirit. Could it be that the wilderness is Gods training\nground? Where we learn the ways of the Spirit? Could it be that\nGod-initiated spiritual warfare, is one of the things God chooses to\nuse, to help us discover our true identity in him and our need of the\nHoly Spirit? Because the Father loved his Son Jesus, the Spirit led\nhim to and through the wilderness so Jesus could teach us the essence\nof what it means to be a child led by the Spirit. </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Let\nme conclude with a quote used by David Johnson in Gasping for breath </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>In\nhis book, Backpacking with the saints, Belden Lane asks. \u2018What\nhappens when a \u2018gifted child\u2019 find himself in a wilderness where\nhe\u2019s stripped of any way of proving his worth? What does he do when\nthere\u2019s nothing he can do, when there\u2019s no audience to applaud\nhis performance, when he faces a cold, silent indifference, if not\nhostility? His world falls to pieces. The soul hungry for approval\nstarves in a desert like that.\u2019 pp 53</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>This\nis why it is so important to submit to the leading of the Spirit no\nmatter where He leads.

How would you define Christian\nministry? What is Christian Ministry? How we answer this question is\nvery important. Let me share a true story.</strong></strong></p><p><strong>\n<strong>On\nJune 13</strong></strong><strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup></strong><strong><strong>\n1995 The Chicago Tribune ran a story about a man named</strong></strong><strong><strong><br/>\n</strong></strong><strong><strong>Russell\nEdward Herman died at the age of 67 and in his will he left trillions\nof dollars to thousands of people he\u2019d never met. Here is a summary\nof some of what he bequeathed:-</strong></strong><strong><strong><br/>\n<br/>\n</strong></strong><strong><strong>\u2022\n</strong></strong><strong><strong>$1.5\nBillion for \u201cprojects\u201d in southeastern Illinois</strong></strong><strong><strong><br/>\n</strong></strong><strong><strong>\u2022\n</strong></strong><strong><strong>$6\nTrillion to the Federal Reserve Board to pay off the National Debt.</strong></strong><strong><strong><br/>\n</strong></strong><strong><strong>\u2022\n</strong></strong><strong><strong>$6\nTrillion to the U.

Russell Edward Herman didn\u2019t have trillions of\ndollars. He was just a simple, poor carpenter. While the will of the\nlate Russell Herman never paid off for his \u201cbeneficiaries,\u201d it\ncertainly enlivened conversations. Russell Edward Herman had great\nintentions, but he lacked the resources needed to make them a\nreality. His will, as a legal document,  had the right title, was\nfiled correctly, but it did not perform as expected. It was\nineffective! </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Although\nwe can see the funny side of this, something like this can often\nhappen when it comes to Christian ministry. In ministry, it is\npossible for people to have great hopes, wonderful vision, deep\nlonging to see people lives transformed, but not have the power or\nresources to accomplish what they had hoped.  It is easy for any\nministry to slide into a maintenance mode where their goal is to keep\nthings ticking over, where the status quo is sustained. </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>I\ndon\u2019t believe for one moment that people who see their ministry\ndecline into solely a maintenance role, are bad people. Nor am I\ndismissing the importance</strong></strong><strong><strong>,\nof maintenance as I\u2019m aware that it requires love, support and a\ngreat deal of effort. I will never forget a missionary in France\ntelling me he was happy \u2018to flog a dead horse.\u2019 Sadly many who\nare involved in ministry have succumb to the same attitude.

So that is why this passage\nin Luke 4:14-21 is an essential requirement if we are going to have a\nbiblical understanding of ministry. </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Father\nforgive my if I am involved in a ministry that is busy dying.  </strong></strong><em><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan Proverbs 27:11-3o:33</strong></em></p>",

What a contrast,\nglory, kingdoms and authority, or the Power of the Spirit. A position\nof influence or the power of the Spirit. It may be that Jesus was\nopen to the power of the Spirit because he had turned his back on all\nworldly understandings of power and authority. He understood that the\nworld needs a Spirit filled servant more than a worldly king. </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>3.\n Luke wants to introduce us to the ministry of Jesus and how Jesus\nunderstood his ministry and what he had been called to do. It is\ninteresting to notice that Jesus\u2019 power to do his ministry, and his\nunderstanding of his ministry both were related to \u2018Spirit of the\nLord\u2019 being upon him.

Why would he do that?

What can we learn from Jesus\nunderstanding of his ministry?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>1.\nA Spirit filled ministry gives people a right understanding about God\nby revealing the heart of God.</strong></strong></p><p><strong>Before\nJesus came, people had been wondering what God is really like...\nThere had been 400 years of silence in terms of no recognised prophet\ndeclaring the will of God. You can imagine what the people thought.\nDoes He hate us? Is He sick of us? Will He come to judge? Does He\ncare about what we are going through down here on earth? And then God\nbecame a man and we could see what He was like. He came for the\npoor... the afflicted... the broken-hearted... the captive, the\nsinners. He came to set them free. Jesus\u2019 ministry, corrected and\nchanged peoples understanding of God. Ministry should always be about\nbringing the heart of God to a broken world. This is so radical, for\nJesus living a Spirit filled life was about engaging in people lives.\n</strong><strong>The\nterm for poor (</strong><em><strong>ptochos</strong></em><strong>)\nrefers to those who are abjectly poor or utterly destitute. The most\ncommon term for poor in the Hebrew Bible (\u2018</strong><em><strong>ani</strong></em><strong>)\ncarries with it the notion of economically poor, but it also suggests\nthe idea of oppression, exploitation and suffering.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nbible has many verses that say we should be continually caring for\nthe poor for example:- </strong></p><p><strong><strong>Deuteronomy\n15:7<br/>\n</strong></strong><strong>\u201cBut\nif there are any poor Israelites in your towns when you arrive in the\nland the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hard-hearted or\ntight-fisted toward them.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Deuteronomy\n15:10<br/>\n</strong></strong><strong>\u201cGive\ngenerously to the poor, not grudgingly, for the Lord your God will\nbless you in everything you do.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Deuteronomy\n15:11<br/>\n</strong></strong><strong>\u201cThere\nwill always be some in the land who are poor. That is why I am\ncommanding you to share freely with the poor and with other\nIsraelites in need.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Deuteronomy\n24:14<br/>\n</strong></strong><strong>\u201cNever\ntake advantage of poor and destitute labourers, whether they are\nfellow Israelites or foreigners living in your towns.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Deuteronomy\n27:19<br/>\n</strong></strong><strong>\u201cCursed\nis the man who withholds justice from the alien, the fatherless or\nthe widow.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Proverbs\n14:31<br/>\n</strong></strong><strong>\u201cHe\nwho oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is\nkind to the needy honours God.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>Ezekiel\n18:5-9</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>Suppose\nthere is a righteous man</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>who\ndoes what is just and right. He does not eat at the mountain shrines\nor look to the idols of Israel. He does not defile his neighbour\u2019s\nwife or have sexual relations with a woman during her period. He does\nnot oppress anyone, but returns what he took in pledge for a loan.</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>He\ndoes not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides\nclothing for the naked. He does not lend to them at interest or take\na profit from them. He withholds his hand from doing wrong and judges\nfairly between two parties.</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>The\nimplications of these verses are, if we do not care for the poor we\nare guilty of theft.</strong></p><p><strong>The\npower of the Spirit in our lives will always cause a connection with\nthose who are destitute and poor. </strong></p><p><strong>2.\nA spirit filled ministry enhances our humanity by compensating for\nour limitations. </strong></p><p><strong>\n</strong><strong><strong>Let\nme read you a quote.</strong></strong></p><p><strong>\u2018<strong>Jesus\nwas indeed a human being, a genuine human person, owning all the\nlimitations that pertain to humanity, and Jesus depended upon the\nHoly Spirit throughout his entire life to enable him to burst the\nboundaries of his human limitations. The Holy Spirit who descended\nupon him at his baptism, entered into him, and filled him, was the\nSpirit of God who infused him with the power to overcome temptations,\nteach with authority, challenge established religious structures in\nthe name of God, see people not in the mass but as individuals, sense\nthe inner joy of each person or their pain and hurt, reach out and\ntouch people, lift them up, help them, heal them, find them, redeem\nthem, save them, restore them to wholeness, and turn them back to\nGod. In a word, to effectually carry to completion the mission his\nFather had given him to do and which only He could do in this fallen\nbroken world.\u2019 Gerald Hawthorne.  </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>We\nhave got limitations, sometimes we complain and moan about them. We\noften think \u2018if only,\u2019 \u2018if only I could do this, or if only I\nhad that gift or ability God could really use me.\u2019 We fall into the\ncomparison game. We are slow to recognise that our limitations are\nwhat teach and remind us that we need a continual and growing of the\npower and presence of the Spirit in our lives. Matthew 6:1-2, teach\nthat giving to the poor is an act of righteousness, and any lack of\ngenerosity on our part is an expression of unrighteousness.

So they understand the poor as those who are\nspiritually poor, the captives, as those who are captive to sin, the\nblind are those who are spiritually blind and the oppressed are those\nwho are oppressed by Satan. This is a legitimate but incomplete\nunderstanding, caused by a wrong understanding of the gospel.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>When\nit comes to sharing the gospel there are two indispensable parts,\nthere is the message of the gospel and the mercy of the gospel. For\nthe most part the western church has focused on the message of the\ngospel, making evangelism lopsided. We have turned the presentation\nof the gospel into a cerebral event, with reasoning, apologetics,\nquestions, debate, preaching and conversation. All these are good,\nhowever, in and of themselves they are insufficient without the mercy\nof the gospel.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>When\nwe reduce the ministry of the Spirit down to the words that we say,\nthen we have not really grasped the heart of God. You could say that\nevangelism is essentially a call to get your hands dirty in the messy\nlives of the lost.     </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>For\nJesus, the gospel was a radical expression of relevance, it was\nwholistic, it was as much about life before dying as it was about\nlife after dying. The Spirit upon Jesus not only drove him into the\nwilderness, but it also compelled him to be involved in the lives of\nthe poor, the captive, the blind and the oppressed. A Spirit filled\nlife is the antithesis to selfishness, it is an empowered life that\nwill continually make sacrifices in order to engage with the needy\nand marginalised. </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>In\n200</strong></strong><strong><strong>8\nDavid Knepprath and Josh Guisinger moved into the rough-and-tumble\ndown Barberry Village complex in America. Roughly a dozen young\nChristian men and women have made Barberry Village their home. </strong></strong><strong>Their\ngoal: To create a sense of community in a chaotic neighbourhood\noverrun with drugs, prostitution and gangs. Their work mirrors, in\nsome ways, the \"new monasticism\" movement, in which\nChristians move into urban or rural areas to work with the poor. It's\nnot an easy way to live. Some neighbours have been suspicious. Safety\nis an ongoing concern. And some of these urban missionaries have\nburned out on a project that can be a 24-hour-a-day burden. Yet\nthey've been so successful that other complex owners asked them to\nreplicate their efforts. Congregations have volunteered their\nservices. A woman from Virginia is moving to the Portland area so she\ncan do similar work in another neighbourhood. Now, at least once a\nmonth, churches cook meals for the residents at Barberry Village. In\nearly August, children were invited to a three-day Bible camp.\nGuisinger and Knepprath and their friends have also helped people\nmove. They've thrown birthday parties for neighbours. And they\ncleaned up one woman's flooded apartment. Police officers are still\ndispatched to Barberry Village on a regular basis, sometimes more\nthan once a day. But many neighbours say the complex is safer,\nfriendlier and better for children. A former manager called the young\nmen and women a \"godsend.\"\"I hope they continue to do\nthis,\" said Eugenia Swartout, who lives at the complex with her\nfamily. \"It gives us some safety and security knowing there are\nkind people out here and not just bad guys.\"In the beginning, it\nwas just a group of guys. </strong></p><p><strong><strong>Life\nin the Spirit is explicitly incarnational and practical. It give us\nthe ability to relate to people and their real needs.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>4.\nLife in the Spirit need to be consistent with biblical truth.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Jesus\ndescribed his experience of the Spirit with biblical language. He\nquotes Isaiah 61:1-2 and part of Isaiah 58:6. For Jesus his\nexperience of the Spirit was not some kind of mystical experience\nthat made him feel good about himself, rather, his was an experience\nthat allowed him to be secure enough to accomplish the will of the\nFather for his life by laying his life down for others.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>I\nthink that there is a possibility that we have a too subjective\nunderstanding of what life in the Spirit is, it has become another\nmeans of seeking an emotional high, or self fulfilment. Of course\nthere is real deep joy in living a Spirit filled life, but that joy\nshould move us out of self-centred living to a life of sacrificial\nservice and radical love for others.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>5\nLife in the Spirit requires great courage.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>When\nJesus read from Isaiah he chose not complete verse 2, which speaks\nabout the \u2018day of God\u2019s anger against their enemies.\u2019 NLT</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>The\nomission of the next phrase in Isaiah 61:2\u2014\u2018day of God\u2019s anger\nagainst their enemies.\u2019\u201dNLT\u2014is also significant. Jesus\u2019\naudience would suppose that the day of their own salvation would be\nthe day of judgment on their pagan enemies. But the delay of judgment\nmeans that this time of the Lord\u2019s favour benefits the Gentiles\nalso.

They could not accept the message of\ngrace. They reduced the gospel to fit into their agenda and\nexpectations. The thought that God would love a pagan widow from\nZeraphath and a pagan general from Syrian revolted them. So in the\nmiddle of synagogue worship, \u2018they jumped up and forced Jesus to\nthe edge of the of the hill on which the town was built. \u2018They\nintended to push him over the cliff.\u2019 In that culture when someone\nwas going to be stoned to death they were usually thrown of a cliff\nfirst.

He was conceived by the power of\nthe Spirit, at his baptism he was anointed by the Spirit. He was led\ninto and through the wilderness by the Spirit. And he u</strong></strong><strong><strong>nderstood\nhis ministry to be empowered by the Spirit. All his life was defined\nby the power of the Spirit. If that is the case, then we need to try\nand discover if the Holy Spirit played any role in his death and\nresurrection. There is no mention in the gospels about the role of\nthe Spirit during the death or resurrection of Jesus, however outside\nthe gospels we find some indications of the role and help of the\nSpirit in Jesus\u2019 life at this time.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>The\nholy Spirit at the death of Jesus.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>In\nHebrews 9:14 we read </strong></strong><strong><strong>\n\u201c</strong></strong><strong><strong>the\nblood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself\nwithout blemish to God.\u201d This is not an easy phrase to understand.\nWhat is the writer to the Hebrews referring to when he speaks of the\n\u2018eternal Spirit?\u2019 Some people think, that because </strong></strong><strong><strong>o</strong></strong><strong><strong>f\nthis unique title, \u2018eternal Spirit,\u2019 which is only found here in\nthe bible, that it must not be the Holy Spirit, but the divine spirit\nof Jesus.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>This\nis not the only unique title that the writer to the Hebrews has for\nthe Holy Spirit. </strong></strong><strong><strong>In\nHebrews 10:29 most bibles translate the name of the Spirit as the\nSp</strong></strong><strong><strong>irit\nof grace, which is another unique title. </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Some\ncommentators think that the eternal spirit in this verse is referring\nto Jesus\u2019 divine nature as an eternal Son. But this could not be\nthe case because Jesus needed to die as a sinless man, not a divine\nbeing with extra internal resources that would be eliminated or\nusurped his humanity.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Writing\nabout this Gerald F Hawthorne says:-</strong></strong></p><p><strong>\u2018<strong>Did\nhe not begin his epistle with a most exalted view of Jesus,\ndescribing him as Son, Divine, God even (Heb 1:2-12)? Yes, to be\nsure. And yet paradoxically his emphasis throughout this document is\nupon the genuineness of Jesus\u2019 humanity. He certainly affirmed the\npreexistence of Jesus, but he equally affirms the realness of Jesus\nas a human being. But it is fundamental to his entire argument that\nJesus faced life and death as a person of flesh and blood (Heb 2:14),\nnot a person who by virtue of his divine nature had a distinct and\nunparalleled advantage over all other persons. The writer to the\nHebrews believed that Jesus \u201chad to be made like [other people] in\nevery way\u201d (2:7 NEB), that he was \u2018\u2019tempted in every way, just\nas we are \u2013 yet without sin\u201d (4:15 NIV), and that \u201che himself\nsuffered when he was tempted\u201d (2:18 NIV). He believed that Jesus,\nin facing his own death, was in desperate straits and that as a\nconsequence he prayed with loud cries and tears to God who could save\nhim from death (5:7). The writer believed, perhaps, that in\nGethsemane, Jesus faced his greatest of all temptations \u2013 the\nintense temptation to live, the temptation to flee death, to draw\nback from the cross, to say \u201cNO\u201d to the Father\u2019s will for\nwhatever reasons might have been coursing through his mind. But just\nas Jesus had overcome all previous temptations, even temptations to\ngo his own way and do his own will, aided in these victories by the\nHoly Spirit, so now as well...Just as Jesus was strengthened\nthroughout his life by the Holy Spirit upon whom he had depended to\nhelp him make the right moral choices, so now at this ultimately\ncrucial moment he was strengthened by the Spirit so he was able to\nchoose for God and against himself and say, </strong></strong><strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201dNot\nmy will but yours!</strong></span></strong><strong><strong>\nHere I am! I have come to do your will, O God\u201d (Heb. 10:7 Mark\n14:34-36).  </strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>John\nMacArthur puts it this way \"Jesus did everything He did on earth\nin obedience to the Father through the Spirit.

They had been physically assaulted, their homes had been\nplundered; some had been cast into prison on account of their faith,\nothers had been ridiculed in public because of their resolute trust\nin Jesus (10:32\u201334).

They are right. In fact, the Greek word used here for\n\u201ctemptation\u201d can be used to speak of both suffering and sin.. </strong></p><p><strong>However,\nwhen we look to the context of the passage to determine which meaning\nPaul intended, we find that he is addressing sin, not suffering.\nVerse 6 addresses those who \u201cdesire evil.\u201d In verse 7 Paul\naddresses \u201cidolaters,\u201d showing the context of this passage is\nsin. Verse 8 identifies this idolatry specifically as \u201csexual\nimmorality.\u201d The following verses continue to address sin as we\nread of \u201cput(ting) Christ to the test\u201d in verse 9 and grumbling\nin verse 10.

Verse 13\ncontinues to address sin within the context of these verses. The\nplain reading of this text should lead us to conclude that Paul chose\nto use the word \u201ctemptation\u201d to address temptation to sin, not\ntrials and suffering, in this passage. </strong></p><p><strong>This\nverse is ensuring us that God will provide an escape from the\ntemptation of potential sin. However it is not saying that we will be\nkept from suffering nor is it saying that God\u2019s will for our lives\nis tailored to our physical, emotional or psychological abilities or\nstrengths. The will of God can be beyond our capacities to cope and\nway outside our comfort zones, making the empowering of the Spirit\nmore necessary. For Jesus in his humanity, the ability to offer\nhimself to God was aided by the power of the eternal Spirit.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nis one other thing we need to mention. The word \u2018offered\u2019 in this\nverse is very suggestive. I think it says a lot about the heart of\nJesus, he did not see himself as a victim caught in the cruel claws\nof horrific circumstances which could appear outside the control of\nGod. Rather, through the power of the Spirit he viewed the\ncircumstances of his death as a means whereby he could offer his life\nto God in death. This offering attitude made acceptance of the cross\npossible.</strong></p><p><strong>Wouldn\u2019t\nit be amazing if the power of the Spirit in our lives were to\ntransform our thinking about ourselves so that we would begin to\nunderstand and live as if our lives were an offering onto God, and\nthat through the Spirit\u2019s power we could accept the challenges,\ndemands, sacrifices and losses his will for our lives will entail.  </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that you always provide a way to escape from sinning </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Isaiah 1:10-5:17</p>",

It\u2019s the only Levitical Feast Day\nbetween the 3 spring feasts (Passover, Unleavened Bread, and First\nFruits) and the 3 in the autumn festivals (Rosh Hashanna, Yom Kippur,\nand Tabernacles). The Hebrew name for this Day is Shavuot, which\nmeans weeks, so in Israel it\u2019s often called the Feast of Weeks.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nknow from the Old Testament that this feast was originally ordained\nby God so that His people could celebrate the early harvest. In\nPalestine there were two harvests each year. The early harvest came\nduring the months of May and June; the final harvest came in the\nautumn. Pentecost was the celebration of the beginning of the early\nwheat harvest. The word Pentecost means fifty, so 7 weeks and 1 day\nafter the celebration of the Passover, Jerusalem would have been\nfilled with people celebrating the feast.   </strong></p><p><strong>For\nChristians, Pentecost should be a very important day, although sadly\nthe protestant tradition has played it down and hasn\u2019t really\ngrasped its importance. It should be a day of celebration just like\nChristmas day and Easter Sunday. For on the Day of Pentecost, God the\nHoly Spirit came to live in mankind, and the world became a new\nplace. The day of Pentecost is slightly different to our Christmas\nand Easter celebration in this regard. At Christmas and Easter we\ncelebrate what Jesus did for us through his birth, death and\nresurrection.

It\nis one of the ways Jesus demonstrated his victory over Satan, sin and\ndeath.

Originally the word was used\nto describe a witness in a court, and was not used to describe\nsomeone who had died for their faith. Sometimes the same word was\nused to describe God, see Romans 1:9, John 15v26-27 or a false\nwitness. Matthew 26:59.

Since the most striking\nwitness which Christians could bear to their faith was to die rather\nthan deny it, the word soon began to be used in reference to one who\nwas not only a witness, but specifically a martyr.\u2019 (Encyclopaedia\nBritannica, 200th Anniversary Edition, 1969, \u201cMartyr\u201d, Volume\n14.) </strong></p><p><strong>When\nthe Holy Spirit really touches a person\u2019s life, that person\ndevelops the attitude of a martyr.

The Holy Spirit needs to work in the\nChurch so </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>e\ncan work in the world.  When a church becomes insular and inward\nlooking, you know that is not a church that is filled with the Holy\nSpirit. The more relevant the church is, the more the world will see\nthe Glory of Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>These\ndisciples were able to relate to and communicate with people who were\nbeyond their experience and understanding. The Holy Spirit is a\nmissionary Spirit, and he can only reach the world by having his way\nin the church. </strong></p><p><strong>Just\nbefore we go on let me mention that if you read the gospels you will\nnotice that when Jesus spoke about evangelism and reaching the world,\nhe was always positive. He spoke about the field being white, ready\nfor harvest in John 4. And how the harvest was plentiful but the\nworkers were few in Matthew 9. </strong></p><p><strong>Was\nJesus being naive? no, not at all, b</strong><strong>ecause</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>e\nknew that the Holy Spirit that energises the church, is the same\nmissionary Spirit that reaches the lost.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nwork of the Holy Spirit in the church will cause the world to ask\nquestions.</strong></p><p><strong>I\nthink sometimes we believe that being relevant means that we make\npeople feel comfortable, and that is true. But it also can mean to\nbring a challenge. In this passage we are told that the crowd were\nbewildered, utterly amazed and perplexed.  (See Acts 2 verses 6, 7,\nand 12.) The Greek terms describing their reactions could be\nappropriately rendered as confused, in an uproar, beside themselves,\nblown away. </strong></p><p><strong>The\npower of the Spirit is for all who love Jesus. </strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe are used to thinking that God only wants to use a certain type of\nperson, or a certain gender, or a certain age for conveying his plans\nand purposes, then we are wrong.  God\u2019s Spirit tells us otherwise.\nAll people, boys and girls, young and old, free and slaves, whether\nthey be women or men. See Acts 2:17-18. </strong></p><p><strong>At\nPentecost all the institutional norms were abolished. There was no\nmore spiritual elite. There was no more gender exclusion. There was\nno more ageism when it came to being used by God. Pentecost\ninaugurated a new way to serve God. Because Jesus is glorified, and\nthe Holy Spirit has come, then no-one on the basis of ability,\nstatus, gender or age can be nor should be excluded from being\nsomeone through whom God can speak to </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>is\nworld.   </strong></p><p><strong>On\nthe Day of Pentecost all the disciples were gathered together in one\nplace, somewhere in Jerusalem.  Think about that, the very place\nwhere Jesus was killed, the very place where the Roman authorities\nand religious leaders conspired together. This was the very place\nwhere Satan and his evil demons were allowed to carry out the most\nwicked deed ever done on planet earth. It was into this place of\ngreat spiritual darkness and injustice that the Holy Spirit came and\nbrought new life and hope. Where we are may not be as dark and\ndifficult as Jerusalem was in those days, however, we need to\nexperience our localised Pentecost. We need the Spirit of God to come\nupon us so we can reach the people around us. What God may do in this\nlocation through the working of His Spirit may be very different to\nwhat happened in Jerusalem; we may not experience a violent rushing\nwind, or have tongues of fire rest upon us, but we must allow God to\nmanifest the power of His Spirit in ways that he deems appropriate\nfor us and the situation He has placed us in. Father please give your\nchurch a new experience of your Spirit. </strong><em><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan Isaiah 19:11-24:6</strong></em></p>",

The word \u2018klaio\u2019 is used in verse 38 for\nweeping. It is a word that indicates loud sobs, howling.

We can stand before\nhim completely accepted. However, forgiveness cannot eradicate\nconsequence of the sin we have done to others or the sin others have\ndone to us. Forgiveness removes the punishment for sin not the\neffects of sin. Forgiveness is instantaneous,  dealing with the\ndamaging consequences of sin, be it ours or others is  a process.\nForgiveness will not allow us to bury our heads in the sand and\nignore what is going inside us. We bury our stuff because of shame\nand guilt. </strong></p><p><strong>As\nthis women sobbed maybe she felt safe enough in the presence of Jesus\nto mourn her past, to grieve her wounds. We are incline to hide all\nour stuff under neglect and busyness, choosing not to recognise the\naffects it has on our lives.

We don\u2019t want to face the pain of dealing\nwith all the pain caused by and to us, our shame causes us to bury\nthe scars of our sin. The problem is, this is not a benign\nexperience.

He had lived in the wilderness,\npreaching to the people. He had faithfully declared an unpopular\nmessage. He had done all as had God asked, but now he was imprisoned\nin the dungeon of an old fortress near the Dead Sea.  In prison, John\nmust have doubted the justice of God. He must\u2019ve wondered if He had\nmade a mistake. His circumstances clouded his perspective.</strong></p><p><u><strong>Reasons\nfor doubt.</strong></u></p><p><strong>As\nwe look at this incident from the life of John the Baptist there are\na number of reasons why John may have doubted at this time.</strong></p><p><strong>At\na superficial level Johns doubt was related to his circumstances.\nJohn, the very man who had attracted a flurry of attention in recent\nyears because of his \u2018no-holds-barred\u2019 announcements of a New\nWorld order that was just around the corner.

His\nwinnowing fork is in His hand, and He will clear His threshing floor,\ngathering His wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with\nunquenchable fire'\" (Mt. 3:10-12). </strong></p><p><strong>That\nwas the kind of person John expected; that was the kind of Messiah he\nwas looking for. And here is Jesus, out in the backwaters of Galilee\nhealing the sick, insignificant people here and there, but He was not\ndoing anything to really change the basic structural problems in\nIsrael's life. Rome was still in control, the Pharisees still\ncommanded the religious life of the nation, the Sadducees still were\nin charge of the temple, and the whole \"system\" seemed not\nto be threatened by the good Jesus was doing. What John taught about\nJesus was partly true. Jesus would come in judgement, but not yet.\nSometimes we are like John, we have some truth, and we put our\nexpectations on half of the truth. </strong></p><p><strong>For\nJohn his doubt was an expression of disappointment with Jesus, many\npeople do not love Jesus enough to be disappointed with him.

When we are\ntotally honest with Jesus, then our hearts are more open to receive\nhis encouragement and comfort. Jesus will always defend those who\nhave honest doubts. The interesting thing about these words in this\ncontext is that Jesus was anxious to defend John\u2019s reputation.</strong></p><p><strong>He\ndid not change Johns circumstances. John was in prison, John stayed\nin prison, John was murdered in prison. If anything, his\ncircumstances got worse.

Jesus\nunderstood that he did not need to change, what he was doing was\nconsistent with His Father\u2019s will. Doubting people can become angry\nand demanding. When John asked his question, he was challenging\nJesus, attempting to force his hand, to press Jesus to announce that\nHe was the Messiah, and to cause Him to begin to bring judgement to\nthe earth.

The question of whether a handicapped child suffered the\nhandicap from the sins of their parents or his/her own pre-natal sin\nwas actively debated in Judaism. There is actually a rabbinic\npronouncement from near the time of Jesus, \"When a pregnant\nwoman worships in a heathen temple the fetus also commits idolatry.\"\nTherefore, when a baby was born who was anything less than perfect,\nblame could be placed on the child if no sin were evident in the\nparents.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nthe first century the popular folk-theology of the Jews saw a direct\nunderlying connection between illness and sins. They lived in a cause\nand effect world. Bad things happen to bad people. Good things happen\nto good people. In a cause and effect world, everything is orderly,\npredictable, and understandable. In a \"cause and effect\"\nworld, those who study the hardest excel; those who work the longest\nprosper.

That was not true in the case of this blind man, but it\nis often true. Not all suffering is caused by sin, but sin does cause\nsuffering. Jesus shows us that sin and suffering are not always\nrelated, but not that they are never related.  There are texts in\nScripture that clearly indicate that people are hurting and suffering\nand physically depraved and deprived because of their own evil ways.\nSee 1 Corinthians 11:30.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nare not in a position to decide or judge if a person is suffering\nbecause of sin, that is for God to know, not us; that kind of\nknowledge would be too dangerous for us to have.  John Wimber,\nfounder of the Vineyard Movement in his book, Power Healing, said,\n\"There are many reasons that people are not healed. Most of the\nreasons involve some form of sin and unbelief. Some do not have faith\nin God for healing; (and some have) personal, unconfessed sin (which)\ncreates a barrier to God\u2019s grace.\u2019 p. 152 The cause of suffering\nshould not determine our response to it.</strong></p><p><strong>Do\nchildren suffer because of their parent\u2019s sin?

    "html": "<p><u><strong>A\nfew initial observations.</strong></u></p><p><strong>The\nNew Testament records more accounts of Jesus restoring sight than any\nother miracle (Mk. 18:22-26; 10:46-52; Mt. 9:27-31; 12:22-23; 21:14;\nMk. 8:22-26; Jn. 9:1-41). This predicted Messianic activity (Isa.\n29:18; 35:5; 42:7) it became somewhat of a hallmark of His ministry.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nnever healed two blind people in the same way, he treated people as\nindividuals. It is so easy when ministering unto others to try and\nestablish some kind of formula,  or a \u2018one size fits all\u2019\napproach, but in doing this we cease to treat people as people and\nmore like objects. </strong></p><p><strong>It\nis quite striking that the only reference to healing of blindness in\nthe Bible other than in Jesus' ministry, is the case of Paul it was\nJesus who both blinded and restored  him. So Jesus' healing of the\nblind stands out as a major sign of his identity and the significance\nof his coming.</strong></p><p><strong>Look\nat what Jesus did here.</strong></p><p><strong>Firstly\nJesus took the initiative. This blind man did not ask Jesus to heal\nhim; Jesus saw his need and responded. Secondly, the method used by\nJesus in the healing of the blind man might sound a little unusual to\nus, but would have been commonly practice in ancient times. The\napplication of herbs and poultices to infected areas of the body was\nwidely accepted as the proper application of their limited medical\nscience. Certainly, the poultice had no intrinsic healing power. John\nemphasizes the use of the mud mentioning it in 9:6, 11, 14, 15. There\nhas been much debate about why Jesus did this. Some commentators\nbelieve that there is allusion to the biblical picture of God as a\npotter and human beings as clay (for example, Job 10:9; Is 45:9;\n64:8; Jer 18:6; Rom 9:2,) but this is unlikely because the picture of\nthe potter in the bible is primarily a picture of someone who is in\nthe process of judging or disciplining his people while they are\nstill on the earth. Jesus did not need to put the mud on this blind\nman in order to heal him, but he chose to do so. </strong></p><p><strong>I\nwonder could I make a suggestion as to a \u2018possible\u2019 reason why\nJesus chose to use this method at this time. To teach his disciples a\nvery important lesson. Jesus knew that as he spat on the ground and\nmade the mud, he was breaking the oral traditions on the elders and\nthe expectations of the religious leaders. </strong></p><p><strong>Rabbinic\nteaching perverted Old Testament into a straight-jacket catalogue of\nrules. In healing this man on the Sabbath, Jesus violated four of\ntheir rules: ploughing (spittle rolling on the dirt), kneading\n(making the clay), anointing (putting clay on the man's eyes), and of\ncourse healing (illegal unless a life-threatening emergency). Jesus\nhated the way religion elevated ritual observance over human need,\nand never hesitated to break its rules. Jesus was saying, if you are\nfrightened of men, and feel that you must conform to their rules and\ntraditions, and then you will not show love and compassion to those\nwho need it.</strong></p><p><strong>Thirdly\nsent to Siloam, a parable of his life of faith.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nhealing was not effected until the man obeyed Jesus' command: </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><em><strong>Go\n. . . wash in the Pool of Siloam</strong></em></span><strong>\n(9:7). Why didn't Jesus just heal him on the spot, as he did others?\nWhy send a </strong><em><strong>blind</strong></em><strong>\nman, in particular, on such a journey? There must be something\ninvolved here that contributes to the revealing of God's work.   </strong></p><p><em><strong>The\npool of Siloam was built by Hezekiah during the reign of the Assyrian\nking, Sennacherib, about 600 years before this event. When the\nAssyrians threatened to lay siege to Jerusalem, Hezekiah built a\ntunnel from the Spring of Gihon, under the city walls, to the point\nwithin the walls where the pool was formed. This tunnel was\napproximately 1/3 mile long, running several feet below the surface\nof the ground. Rather than following a straight line, the tunnel\nsnakes its way from source to mouth through hand-hewn limestone. In\norder to speed construction, two groups each started at opposite ends\nand worked towards each other.</strong></em></p><p><strong>What\nJesus did was to demand an act of faith by the man being healed. The\nman could have simply said, \"This is ridiculous,\" wiped the\ndirt from his eyes, and gone home blind. Instead, he had to walk a\ndistance through one of the busiest and most crowded streets of the\ncity to the pool. He would then have to wash his eyes at the pool\nwhile others watched. For a blind man, this would be very difficult.\nHe would have to ask for directions and for help, and he might easily\nfall into some of the crevices alongside the road on the way down. It\nwas difficult, but necessary. For the man needed to know that to\nbecome a man of vision didn\u2019t mean that all his problems were\nsolved. In going to the pool of Siloam, the blind man learned that\nJesus could be trusted and obeyed.  </strong></p><p><strong>John\ntells us that that the word Siloam means sent. Throughout this gospel\nJesus is referred to as the one whom God has sent 51 times. To follow\nthe sent one will restore our vision, but it will not remove the pain\nand stress of life. For this man to put his faith in Jesus, he would\nface opposition and obstacle, as we shall see in the rest of the\nchapter.  </strong></p><p><strong>The\nspiritual significance of the miracle  </strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Like\nall of the miracles in John, this miracle not only helped a real\nperson by meeting his real physical need (blindness). It was also a\n\"sign\" (</strong><em><strong>sumeion</strong></em><strong>).\nAs the word \"sign\" suggests, it was an \"attesting\nmiracle,\" meaning that its ultimate significance is not in the\nmiracle itself, but in what it reveals symbolically about Jesus'\nunique ability to meet humanity's spiritual needs. In other words,\nJesus' unique ability to restore physical sight to a man born blind\nis a miracle that validates his claim to be the only One who can\nprovide spiritual revelation and understanding to a spiritually blind\nhumanity.\u2019  {Forget the source.} </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that Jesus treated ever blind man he healed differently </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Jeremiah 13:1-16:9</p>",

They were unsure what to\nthink about Jesus.  \"Pharisee\" is from a Greek word\n(pharisaios) taken from the Heb/Aramaic \"Perisha\" meaning\n\"Separated one.\" In the time of Jesus, the Pharisees were\none of the three chief Jewish sects, the others were the Sadducees\nand the Essenes. Of the three, the Pharisees were the most separated\nfrom the ways of the foreign influences that were invading Judaism,\nand from the ways of the common Jewish people in the land. They were\nstrict legalists. They stood for the rigid observance of the letter\nand forms of the Law, and also for the traditions. There were some\ngood men among them, no doubt, but for the most part they were known\nfor their covetousness, self-righteousness and hypocrisy. Nicodemus\ncame to Jesus as a representative of the Pharisees.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus cleansed the temple, as recorded John 2:13-22 this may have\npleased the Pharisees, because they disapproved of how the Priests\nand the Sadducees were using the worship in the temple to rob and\nabuse people.

Nicodemus is thought to be the second most important person\nin Judaism next to the High Priest. Jesus knew of him, because he\ncalls him \u2018Israel teacher.\u2019 He was the top academic and most\nimportant teacher of his day. Notice he says to Jesus, \u2019We know you\nare a teacher sent from God.\u2019 He was not coming to Jesus as a\npersonal seeker.</strong></p><p><strong>Immediate\ncontext</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>John\n2:23\u201325 reads, \u2018Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover\nFestival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in\nhis name. But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew\nall people. He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew\nwhat was in each person.\u2019    These verses described Jesus\u2019\nrefusal to accept shallow, sign-based faith, since in His\nomniscience, He understood the people\u2019s hearts.  This verse could\nbe translated \u201cMany believed in Jesus, but Jesus didn\u2019t believe\nin them.\u201d  The story of Nicodemus is a case in point, since\nNicodemus himself was one of those superficial believers whose heart\nJesus read like an open book. Instead of affirming his profession,\ntrue the Lord refused to accept Nicodemus\u2019s profession of faith,\nwhich was solely based on the signs he had witnessed (v. 2). Jesus\npointed him to the life-transforming nature of saving faith.

He had not been trained at the feet of men such as Gamaleil.\nHe had no diplomas from the leading Jewish schools. Worse yet, he was\na Galilean who were despised by Judaean Jews.

Eventually it was\ntime for one or the other to establish the substantive topic of\nconversation. In most societies it is the privilege of the senior to\nmove the conversation on, to offer topic.

It is on the basis of an assumed superiority, therefore, that\nNicodemus has offered topic for further conversation. In fact, as\ncommonly happens, he offers several possible topics: the concept of\n\u2018rabbi\u2019, the implication of recognizing Jesus as a teacher, the\nsignificance and the provenance of signs.

We live in a world\nwhere power, position, prestige and possessions are important, they\nbecome symbols of our significance and value. This was like the world\nNicodemus lived in.  Power, position, prestige and possessions are\nimportant when we are feeling insecure or unloved. However, being\nborn again born into the family of God, should cause us to feel loved\nand secure because we have been born into a loving family with a\nloving father.   </strong></p><p><strong>Being\nborn again is the goal of the love of God. God gave his Son, to die a\ncruel death on the cross so we could become new people. It is as if\nGod\u2019s pursuing love finds it ultimate satisfaction in the new birth\nof those he has created. I don\u2019t know if you have ever been at a\nbirth, for most it is a wonderful, joyful experience, although it is\nnot easy for the mother. The joy of such an experience is a pale\nshadow of how God feels about a person being born again.</strong></p><p><strong>Being\nborn again means that we don\u2019t ever need to live under\ncondemnation. The new people we become through being born from\nabove/again is designed to live completely free from condemnation.\n\u2018God did not send his Son into the world to condemn it\u2019\ncondemnation is the antithesis to the new birth, and will stop growth\nand maturity.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nmeeting Nicodemus had with Jesus was very disturbing for him.\nNicodemus had a set of fixed ideas of what a Messiah should be like.\nJesus says something that totally destroys Nicodemus\u2019 understanding\nand theology. Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so\nthe Son of Man must be lifted up that everyone who believes may have\neternal life in him.\u201dFor God so loved the world that he gave his\none and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but\nhave eternal life.\u2019 When we read the words \u2018For God so loved the\nworld,\u2019 we often mistakenly think that this verse is talking about\nthe extent of God\u2019s love, how much he loves the world.  But that is\nnot the writer\u2019s intention. When we read \u2018God so loved the world,\nthe writer is referring back to verse 14.  Jesus uses the story of\nMoses lifting up the snake in the wilderness from Numbers 21:4-9 to\nillustrate his death. This is a strange story and disturbing story,\nwhere Jesus compares his death on the cross with a bronze snake, I\nfind this a bit uncomfortable.  In this story snakes were used as a\ncurse sent by God on his people for their ingratitude and rebellion.\nThe snake equalled a curse, and on the cross Jesus became cursed for\nus. God loved the world so much that he gave His Son to bear the\ncurse for us.</strong></p><p><strong>Here\nis the point, Nicodemus would have never conceived of a suffering\nMessiah, or a saviour who would die for others. Nicodemus wanted a\nJesus who fitted neatly into his categories, his understanding, The\nJesus he wanted, and the Jesus who is, were very different, it is\nonly through the new birth are we able to accept Jesus for who he is,\nand not try and make him something we think he should be.  Father\nthank you for the glories oh the new birth</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Jeremiah 28:1-31:20</p>",

      "Verses 5-8 have caused a lot of debate among theologians as to what Jesus meant when he spoke about being \u2018born of the water and the Spirit.\u2019. Jesus is dealing with Nicodemus and he is surprised by Nicodemus\u2019 response to what Jesus has said. \u2018You should not be surprised at my saying you must be born again.\u2019 The word used for surprised is thaumazo, which means to be astonished, and it is where we get our English word traumatic from. Jesus is conscious that Nicodemus is really struggling. So Jesus presents the same truth but in different language. Knowing that Nicodemus was \u2018Israel\u2019s teacher and he was very well versed in the Old Testament Jesus uses the symbolism of the Old Testament to try and communicate the truth to Nicodemus. There are several Old Testament texts that use the symbolism of water and wind to refer to the new life the Spirit gives.",

The way this elder brother thought had\ndeveloped over many years, Now in the first part of the Parable we\nhave very little mention of the Elder son. All we know about him that\nhe had a father and a younger brother. Now the people listening to\nJesus would have picked up on the lack of activity of the elder son\nin the first part of the parable, for in that culture it was the\nresponsibility of an elder son to mediate between his younger brother\nand his father. He had a cultural obligation to try a broker a peace\nbetween his brother and his father.  He was the best placed person\nwho had an opportunity to try and find a solution to the crisis the\nfamily was now experiencing. </strong></p><p><strong>This\nElder brother however was pragmatic when it came to his\nresponsibilities. It suited him better to stand back and say nothing.\nHe was going to gain if his father carried out the request of his\nyounger brother.</strong></p><p><strong>His\nsilence indicated that his own personal gain was more important than\nthe well being of his father and brother and their relationship.\nSometimes we need to step up and take responsibility for situations,\nit is often too easy for us all to step back and say it would be\neasier and better for me not to get involved. </strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes\npeople remain silent because they feel insecure, or they don\u2019t like\nconfrontation. However, this was not the case with the elder son, as\nwe shall see he had no problem with confronting others. His silence\nwas really an expression of selfishness. The inactivity of the elder\nbrother turned him into someone who could not understand or display\ngrace. Remaining silent when he knew he should have spoken began the\nprocess of him developing into a person who could not or would not\nunderstand grace.</strong></p><p><strong>He\nwas an angry man. Jesus wants us to know what was going on in the\nheart of this older brother. He was angry.  Jesus does not tell us\nwho he is angry with or why. He may be angry because of the actions\nof his father, in throwing such a lavish party for his younger\nbrother. (In giving the party the father had to use the elder\nbrothers\u2019 resources which of course he wouldn\u2019t have been happy\nabout.)</strong></p><p><strong>On\na surface level we could probably sympathise with the elder brother.\nHe had stayed at home and worked hard in order to protect the part\ninheritance he had received. And now here was his father using his\ninheritance to splash out on a big party for his irresponsible\nbrother who just returned. However if we go a bit deeper and look\nbeyond the surface, we will </strong><strong>realise</strong><strong>\nthat for the elder brother his possessions was all he had. He was the\nkind of person who measured his value and success by the things he\nhad. His distance from his father produced in him a materialistic\nmindset \u2018what I possess is more important that my relationships,\nand if you touch my stuff I will get angry.\u2019 Anger is not always\nwrong, but it was in this case because it was an expression of\nblatant selfishness.

      "Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace, because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. So Pilate came out to them and asked, \u201cWhat charges are you bringing against this man?\u201d \u201cIf he were not a criminal,\u201d they replied, \u201cwe would not have handed him over to you.\u201d Pilate said, \u201cTake him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\u201d . \u201c But we have no right to execute anyone,\u201d they objected. This took place to fulfil what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die. Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d \u201cIs that your own idea, \u201dJesus asked, \u201c or did others talk to you about me?\u201d \u201cAm I a Jew?\u201d Pilate replied. \u201cYour own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What is it you have done?\u201d Jesus said, \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.\u201d \u201cYou are a king, then!\u201d said Pilate. Jesus answered, \u201cYou say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.\u201d \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, \u201cI find no basis for a charge against him. But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release \u2018the king of the Jews\u2019?\u201d They shouted back, \u201cNo, not him! Give us Barabbas!\u201d Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising. Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe and went up to him again and again, saying, \u201cHail, king of the Jews!\u201d And they slapped him in the face. Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, \u201cLook, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.\u201dWhen Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, \u201cHere is the man!\u201d As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, \u201cCrucify! Crucify!\u201d But Pilate answered, \u201cYou take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.\u201d The Jewish leaders insisted, \u201cWe have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.\u201d When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, and he went back inside the palace. \u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. \u201cDo you refuse to speak to me?\u201d Pilate said. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cYou would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.\u201d From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, \u201cIf you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.\u201d When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge\u2019s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. \u201c Here is your king,\u201dPilate said to the Jews. But they shouted, \u201cTake him away! Take him away! Crucify him!\u201d \u201c Shall I crucify your king?\u201d Pilate asked. \u201c We have no king but Caesar,\u201d the chief priests answered.Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified",
      "W e are going to look at Pilate and his encounter with Jesus. Let me give you a few facts about Pilate, in the other Gospels he is referred to Pountus Pilate, but only Pilate in John. He was the fifth governor of Judea from 25 to 36 Ad",
      "There are 56 references to Pilate in the New Testament and if it were not for that he would not be so well known. Outside the New Testament there are a few references to him. B oth Philo and Josephus paint a very stark portrait of the Roman ruler. Pilate is characterized as oppressive, greedy, he is portrayed as being stubborn, and cruel. Philo specifically catalogues \u201chis venality, his violence, his thefts, his assaults, his abusive behaviour, his frequent executions of untried prisoners, and his endless savage ferocity\u201d ( Gaium 302), though some claim Philo exaggerated the matter. Nonetheless, Pilate did antagonize the Jews and they hated him (though they would later use him for the implementation of their own evil designs).",
      "For example, he introduced into the city of Jerusalem certain ensigns that contained the image of Caesar, an act that infuriated the Hebrews because they considered the overture to be heathenish ( Antiquities 18.3.1; Wars 2.9.2-3). Further, three different coins minted by Pilate have been found by archaeologists. They depict pagan symbols, again reflecting his disdain for the Jewish conscience.\u2019 Jackson, Wayne. \"The Tragedy of Pontius Pilate.\" ChristianCourier.com . Access date: November 21, 2017."

The Jewish leaders have cleansed their homes\nof leaven; they have prepared the passover lambs; they have performed\nthe necessary rituals to insure ritual cleanness.

This took place to fulfil what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die.

But now my kingdom is from another place.\u201d \u201cYou are a king, then!\u201d said Pilate. Jesus answered, \u201cYou say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.\u201d \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d retorted Pilate.

They clothed him in a purple robe and went up to him again and again, saying, \u201cHail, king of the Jews!\u201d And they slapped him in the face. Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, \u201cLook, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.\u201dWhen Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, \u201cHere is the man!\u201d As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, \u201cCrucify! Crucify!\u201d But Pilate answered, \u201cYou take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.\u201d The Jewish leaders insisted, \u201cWe have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.\u201d When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, and he went back inside the palace. \u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. \u201cDo you refuse to speak to me?\u201d Pilate said. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cYou would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.\u201d From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, \u201cIf you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar.

Then he tells\nthem to take Jesus and crucify. As for me I find no basis for a\ncharge against him. 19:6. [b] Luke tells us that Pilate sent Jesus to\nHerod Luke 23:6 [c] He washes his hand in a basin saying \u2018I am\ninnocent of this man\u2019s blood, it is your responsibility.\u2019\nMatthew27:24.  </strong><strong><strong>Pontius\nPilate, the governor, the most powerful man in the region, the only\none with the judicial faculty to hand a man over to death, stands\nbefore a crowd and claims that he is not responsible </strong></strong><strong>for\nwhat he does. He claims that, in violating his own conscience and\nhanding over an innocent man to torture, he is innocent.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>it\u2019s\nnot my fault, he is to blame, I couldn\u2019t help it. I didn\u2019t mean\nto hurt them.\u2019 and people have lots of different ways of avoiding\ntaking responsibilities. Maybe their has been a \u2018Pilate\u2019 in you\nlife, someone at home, at work, at church, at school, someone who has\nmisused their position to hurt. Jesus knows how you feel, Jesus has\nstood where you stand and understands.</strong></p><p><strong>Looking\nat Pilate, we do not see a very nice person, he is a miserable human\nbeing with no redeeming qualities or moral courage who uses his power\nfor self gain and gratification.</strong></p><p><strong>However\nwhen we look at Jesus we see someone who with internal beauty and\nstrength was able to handle the cruel injustices. </strong></p><p><strong>1.\nHe refused to use his power and position for his own benefit. Reading\nabout Jesus before Pilate, you wonder why Jesus would not just call\ndown fire from heaven and show these people his power and strength?\nBut he didn\u2019t, why.</strong></p><p><strong>[a]\nIn the garden he had completely and without reservation submitted\nhimself to his Fathers will, and he knew that this particular\nsuffering was part of his fathers will. On occasions Jesus avoided\nsuffering. Once the people of his own town tried to throw him of a\ncliff in order to kill him, and he walked away. Problem with you and\nme is we don\u2019t always know if our suffer is part of God\u2019s will\nfor us, or are they just the consequences of living in a falling\nworld. I don\u2019t think it is too important to know, but what is\nimportant is that we live surrendered lives. Jesus could stand before\nPilate because he had \u2018kneeled\u2019 in the garden.</strong></p><p><strong>[b]\nJesus never used his power to serve his own needs, this something he\nlearned in the wilderness when he was tempted by Satan. Satan wanted\nhim to assert his power and turn stone into bread in order to feed\nhis hunger, but he refused.</strong></p><p><strong>[c]\nI think another reason why Jesus may not have called fire down from\nheaven and use his divine power was because he knew that when we\nstand before \u2019our Pilate\u2019 we could not do that. He wanted to\nteach us how to handle injustice.</strong></p><p><strong>[d]\nAbove all Jesus wanted to fulfil his Fathers plan of salvation, and\nthrough suffer he gave himself a ransom for many.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nremembered who he was and why he came look at verse 37.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>You\nare a king, then!\u2019  said Pilate. Jesus answered. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018You\nare right in saying I am a king. In fact for this reason I was born,\nand for this I came into the world, to testify to truth.  Everyone on\nthe side of truth listens to me,\u2019</strong></span></p><p><strong>I\nthink this may be the only recorded time Jesus refers to his birth.\nWhen some one suffers the injustice of power abuse by an other\nperson, they can feel worthless and insignificant. But like Jesus we\nhave been born with significance, value and purpose.  </strong></p><p><strong>Suffer\ninjustice is an extremely lonely and painful experience, however\ninjustice is not all powerful, even though it might feel that it is.\nIt cannot rob a person of their value or their God give purpose. It\ncan do a lot of terrible things but it cannot change the reason for\nyour being. The pain of life cannot rob a person of purposes of God. </strong></p><p><strong>Just\nnotice that the purposes of God are always consistent with the truth.\nIf we go into error, or pretence, or denial or unreality, then you\nare not in the will of God. Pilate and Jesus were completely\nopposite. Jesus overcame power with truth.      </strong></p><p><strong>One\nfinal thing Jesus did as he stood before Pilate, he redefined what a\nkingdom was. A kingdom is the authority which you live, and the\nkingdom determines how you live. Jesus said</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u2018my kingdom is not of this world.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n So how Jesus approached life was the antitheses to how Pilate did</strong></p><p><strong>Pilate\nkingdom was about power.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nkingdom is about truth.</strong></p><p><strong>Pilate\nkingdom used force and violence.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nkingdom is about love and grace.</strong></p><p><strong>Pilate\nkingdom was about taking the lives of others.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nkingdom is about laying down you life for others.  </strong></p><p><strong>Pilate\nkingdom was about saving yourself</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nkingdom is about saving others.</strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme  end by quoting the verse we started with,   </strong></p><p><strong>To\nthis you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an\nexample, that you should follow in his steps.</strong><em><strong>\n1Peter 2:21 </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Father\nthank you for the majestic beauty of Jesus and his kingdom. </strong></em><em><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan Jeremiah 51:11-52:34</strong></em></p>",

Mark says, \"When he turned\" It was as if\nJesus was being led away from the other disciples, and before He\nspoke he turned and faced them. Here we have Jesus facing the\nsituation head on. When we are involved in spiritual warfare, we need\nto be real and face things as they really are. Often in </strong>\n\n<strong>church\nlife we skirt around issues, burying things under the mat of\nactivity, hoping that they will go away. The only way we can overcome\nthe temptations of Satan is to face them. It is interesting to note\nthat the word used for tum is the same word that is often used to\ndescribe man's conversion. It suggests a radical </strong>\n\n<strong>change\nof direction. The only way we can resist Satan is to constantly turn\ntowards God and His purposes.</strong></p><p><strong>Secondly,\nJesus looks at His disciples. Mark says 'But when Jesus turned and\n</strong>\n\n<strong>looked\nat his disciples,'  Mark 8:33.  He just didn't look at Peter, but at\nall the disciples. The </strong>\n\n<strong>Greek\nword for looked is \u2018oida,\u2019 which is a word that is derived from\n\u2018eidoto\u2019 see, or perceive by means of the senses. This knowledge,\nhowever, is not deep, it lies </strong>\n\n<strong>near\nthe surface of things. It carries the idea of ascertaining what must\nbe done about a certain situation. So before Jesus speaks, he assess\nthe situation so he can take the appropriate action.</strong></p><p><strong>Then\nJesus rebukes Peter. In Greek, the common word for rebuke is\n\u2018epitimao,\u2019 \" to rebuke, reprove, censure, also, to wan in\norder to prevent an action or bring one to an end. Jesus uses the\nsame word in rebuking the disciples in Luke 9:55. </strong>\n\n<strong>It\nis a word of authority. Jesus rebukes evil spirits (Luke 9:41-43;\nMark 3:12; 9:25), diseases (Luke 4:39), and the elemental forces of\nnature (Mark 4:39). -It is also a word describing how Christian\nbrothers are to relate to each other in a spirit of forgiveness: 'So\nwatch yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke (epitimao) him, and if\nhe repents, forgive him.' (Luke 17:3).</strong></p><p><u><strong>The\ncontent of Jesus' rebuke.</strong></u></p><p><strong>Firstly\nJesus identify Peter with Satan</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\ndoesn't call Pontius, Satan. He doesn't call Herod, Satan (a fox\nmaybe but not Satan). Jesus doesn't call Caiaphas or Annias (the high\npriests), Satan. He calls one of his own Apostles, Satan. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>Peter\u2019s\nrebuke was a repeat of the temptation that Satan offered Jesus in the\nwilderness. 'Again the Devil took him to a very high mountain and\nshowed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour. All\nthis I will give you, he said, if you bow down and worship me.'\nMatthew 4:8. In other words 'Jesus you don't have to suffer, you\ndon't need to go to the cross. Or in Peter's words. 'This shall never\nhappen to you.' Peter's insistence upon an alternatives to suffering\nis a satanic </strong>\n\n<strong>deception.</strong></p><p><strong>One\nof Satan's most effective weapons is not the sword but the velvet\ncushion. He comes to us and convinces us that we don't deserve\nsuffering and pain, that we shouldn't have to suffer, especially for\nthe needs of others. The belief that this life should be free from\nthe humiliation of the cross is a satanic ploy designed to rob us of\nlife. We need our crosses for the sake of others just as much as\nJesus needed his cross for our sake</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me to recognise that the desire and plan  of Satan is to keep \nme from carrying my cross</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> lamentations 1:1-3:51</p>",

The proper\nplace for Satan is behind us, in the sense he mustn't be the object\nof </strong>\n\n<strong>or\nfocus of our attention. This does not mean that we ignore him our\npretend that he doesn't exist. </strong></p><p><strong>Rather,\nit means that we him put him and all that he has done to our lives\nbehind us so we can really pursue God.\n\n\n\nJesus then informs Peter; '</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>You\nare a stumbling block to me.'</strong></span><strong>\nThe word for stumbling block is skandalon from which we get our\nEnglish word scandal. In Greek culture the word was used to describe\nthe trigger in the trap on -which the bait placed which springs the\ntrap when it is touched by the animal, causing the trap to close. It\nwas also used to describe a stone on a pathway on which </strong>\n\n<strong>people\nwould trip.</strong></p><p><strong>Skandalon\nalways denotes the enticement or occasion leading to conduct which\nbrings with it the ruin of the person in question. Skandala are\nthings which lead </strong>\n\n<strong>others\nto turn away from God's salvation and thus to come to ruin. (Matt.\n18:7. Luke 17:1). Imagine how terrible it would be being a stumbling\nblock or a trap to the life of Jesus? </strong></p><p><strong>'Get\nbehind me right now.' In front of me you're Satan, my stumbling\nblock, behind me, you're Peter, my disciple. I can't build my church\non you if you're standing in my way. Get behind me, where followers\nbelong, where the church belongs.'  Lastly Jesus tells us why Peter\nis acting in such a way. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'You\ndo not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.'</strong></span><strong>What\nJesus says here really exposes what if going on in Peter's heart.\nMatthew uses the word (phroneo) for mind. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nword Phroneo comes from the root word Phren that means the inner\nchambers of your heart. The word has an emphasis </strong>\n\n<strong>on\nthe underlying disposition or attitude. Jesus' harsh critique of\nPeter involves </strong>\n\n<strong>more\nthan just the few words he spoke on this occasion, but his inner\nattitude, the disposition of his heart, or we might even say, his\nvery nature.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword also has the sense of 'taking sides', 'supporting the cause of\nsomeone' e.g. when Josephus recounts the story of David's struggle to\nbecome king and the action of Abner, the commander of the opposing\nforces, seeking a political settlement with David. (2 Samuel 3) He\nsays that the elders of Israel 'changed over to David's side'\n(Josephus. Antiquities 7.28). Mark uses this same idiom (8:33) to\ndescribe Peter's action. So Jesus is accusing Peter of shifting his\nloyalties and pursuing Satans agenda.</strong></p><p><strong>No\n\tmatter how many Revelations a person may have received from God,\n\tfrom time to time they will need to experience the confrontation of\n\tJesus.</strong></p><p><strong>We\n\tare all potential instruments in the hand of Satan, and sometimes\n\tthe only way we can be delivered from his influence is through a\n\tharsh confrontation with Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong>The\n\tinfluence of Satan is often appealing, he does not want you to\n\tsuffer, especially for the sake of others.</strong></p><p><strong>God\n\tloves us the way we are, but he loves us too much to let us stay\n\tthat way.</strong></p><p><strong>Peter\nwould have never had become the rock if Jesus hadn't confronted him.\n</strong>\n\n<strong>Not\nhaving a transformed mind can be the biggest threat to the Kingdom of\nGod.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay your confrontation of me transform how I think and how I\nunderstand life. </strong><em><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan Lamentations 3:52-5:22 Ezekiel 1-2</strong></em></p>",

When we think of\nJesus taking up his own cross, that was to mend broken relationships\nbetween God and man, so as we try to understand what 'taking up your\ncross really means, we need to keep in mind the contexts in which\nJesus spoke this command.</strong></p><p><strong>A\nsecond thing we need to keep in mind is that we must not tum the\ncross that Jesus was speaking of here into something it isn't.

'That's my cross,' we say, but this is not what Jesus\nmeant. The </strong>\n\n<strong>problem\nwith this understanding is that most of the pain we go through in\nlife is not of our own choosing.

What Jesus is\ngoing to teach about taking up you cross is designed to protect us\nfrom Satanic influence.</strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhat is Jesus referring to when He speaks about our cross?</strong></p><p><strong>Crucifixion\nin the Ancient World. The cross in Jesus' day was an instrument of\ntorture and execution, pure and simple. There wasn't a figurative use\nof 'cross' as a 'burden' or 'trial' in those days. Death on the cross\nwas a shameful, excruciating, way to die. An ancient Greek poem\ndescribes it this way: Punished with limbs outstretched, they see the\nstake as their fate; </strong>\n\n<strong>They\nare fastened (and) nailed to it in the most bitter torment, evil food\nfor birds of prey and grim pickings for dogs.'</strong></p><p><strong>Psuedo-Manetho,\nApotelesmatica 4:198ff, cited by Martin Hengel, Crucifixion (Fortress\nPress, translated 1977), p. 9.</strong></p><p><strong>'At\nthat time these words of Jesus might have been rendered thus: 'If\nanyone wishes to come after me, let him be prepared to be led out to\npublic execution, following my example' (The Hard Sayings of Jesus,\nF. F. Bruce, p. 150).</strong></p><p><strong>There\nwas no 'norm' for execution on the cross, though it often included\nflogging beforehand, the victim carrying the beam to the place of\nexecution, being nailed to it with outstretched arms, raised up, and\nseated on a small wooden peg. But Seneca indicates there were many\nvariations: 'I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in\nmany different ways: some have their victims with head down to the\nground; </strong>\n\n<strong>some\nimpale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the\ngibbet. \"[15] Seneca, Dialogue 6 (De consolatione ad Marciam)\n20.3.

This miserable procedure made Titus greatly to pity them, while\nthey caught every day five hundred Jews; nay, some days they caught\nmore.' The main reason why he did not forbid that cruelty was that he\nhoped </strong>\n\n<strong>the\nJews might perhaps yield at that sight, out of fear lest they might\nthemselves afterwards be liable to the same cruel treatment. So the\nsoldiers, out of the wrath and hatred they bore the Jews, nailed\nthose </strong>\n\n<strong>they\ncaught, one after one way, and another after another, to the crosses,\nby way of jest, when their multitude was so great, that room </strong>\n\n<strong>was\nwanting for the crosses, and crosses wanting for the bodies.'\nJosephus, Wars of the Jews, 5, 11.</strong></p><p><strong>After\na revolt following the death of Herod the Great, the Roman proconsul\nVarus crucified two thousand Jews. Crucifixion was a common practice\nin the Roman Empire.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus said, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>'Take\nup your cross,'</strong></span><strong>\nthe disciples saw poor condemned souls marching along a road with the\ninstrument of their own death strapped to their backs.

      "Before we look at what Jesus meant when he said 'Take up your cross and follow me,' we need to make a few observations that will help us in our understanding. Depending on what version of the bible you read, the phrase 'take up your cross' is either found five or six times. Many of the older translations include the phrase in Mark 10:21 as part of Jesus response to the Rich Young Ruler, while the more modern translations don't. If you look carefully at every context in which Jesus uses the phrase, it is also in the context of difficult relationships.",
      "In Matthew 10:34-37 Jesus is speaking about difficult relationships, and how the demands of the Kingdom can put great strain on family relationships then He says in Matthew 10:38 'And anyone who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.' This is similar to the context in Luke 14:27 'And whosoever does not carry his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. ' The main difference being, that in Matthew 10 Jesus was speaking to the twelve, while in Luke 14 He is speaking to the crowds."

Many people think that to deny yourself\nmeans that we must feel bad about ourselves, we must loathe\n</strong>\n\n<strong>ourselves,\nwe suffer from a poor self image.

Denying yourself is an </strong>\n\n<strong>expression\nof security not insecurity, it is a volitional choice of our wills,\nnot an emotional response to the world around us.

People who\nsuffer </strong>\n\n<strong>from\nchronic self-image problems can become self-obsessed and very\nselfish, this in turns prevents self-denial.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nGreek word for deny is arneomai means, disown, renounce, refuse, not\nto accept, to reject, to refuse something offered, it carries the\nidea of </strong>\n\n<strong>making\na volitional choice. It is best illustrated in the words of\nPhilippians 2:6-8  'Who being in very nature God, did not consider\nequality with God something to be grasped. But made himself nothing,\ntaking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.\nAnd being found in the appearance of a man he humbled himself, and\nbecame obedient to death even death on a cross.'</strong></p><p><strong>To\ndeny yourself is to choose being a servant over having position of\nauthority. To deny yourself is to choose humility over pride. To deny\nyourself is to choose to obey the will of God irrespective of the\npersonal cost and pain.</strong></p><p><strong>What\nkind of person couldn't make choices like this, the person who is\ninsecure because of a bad self image, the person who hasn't accepted\n</strong>\n\n<strong>themselves,\nso they desperately try to find life in other things and in other\npeople rather than in God. To deny yourself is an expression of self\nacceptance and contentment.</strong></p><p><strong>What\nare the consequences of denying your self?</strong></p><p><strong>You\nwill be able to take up your cross because your focus will not be on\nyour self; you will have a spontaneous, automatic disposition to live\na </strong>\n\n<strong>life\nof self-sacrifice so you can serve others.</strong></p><p><strong>You\nwill discover real life.

During the\nupper room discourse before he died Jesus had some very important\nthings to say to his disciples. The main topic of his conversation\nwas the Holy Spirit.

Much has been\nwritten and said about the Sermon on the Mount.  I think the best way\nto understand it is to see it as Jesus giving us an extended,\nredefined understanding of righteousness. In the Sermon, Jesus\ndescribes for us what true righteousness is like. </strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe hear the word \u2018righteousness\u2019 which is the word Matthew uses\nfor holiness we don\u2019t often get very excited.

We have been brought up to\nthink that living a righteous life, is a call to joyless boredom and\nserious demeanour, which is so far removed for the bibles\nunderstanding of righteousness. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nword for righteousness is from the Greek word dikaiosyne which in the\nbroad sense describes a person who is as he ought to be, i.e.\ndiscovering his/her full potential. It also carries the idea of\njustice, integrity, virtue, purity of life, rightness, correctness of\nthinking feeling, and acting.  We need to think of righteousness as\nsomething that is extremely positive and desirable. It could be\ndescribed as a wholesome mature character.   We are going to look at\nhow Jesus redefined righteousness and painted it in bright attractive\ncolours.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\u2019\n\u2018new take\u2019 on righteousness.</strong></p><p><strong>Righteousness\nrequires an internal passion. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nmust approach to issue of righteousness with passionate hearts.

If you read Matthew chapter five carefully\nyou will notice that Jesus mentions, murder, adultery, divorce and\noaths.

They had never physically murdered someone, or\nphysically slept with another man\u2019s wife. The point that Jesus\nmakes in this passage is, if we have anger or lust in our hearts then\nwe are as guilty as the actual murderer or adulterer.

Eleanor, the matriarch of her family, is dying\nand unable to stand. Grace manages to lift her to her feet. She tries\nto get Eleanor to walk, pushing her gently along. But Eleanor falls\nagain. Grace appears very distressed, and shrieks loudly. She\npersists in trying to get Eleanor to stand, unsuccessfully. Grace\nstays by the fallen figure of Eleanor for another hour, while night\nfalls. If Grace were human, we might have little hesitation in\nattributing to her an emotion of a certain sort: compassion or\nsympathy. But neither Grace nor Eleanor is human. Eleanor is the\nmatriarch of the First Ladies family of elephants. Grace is a younger\nmember of another family of elephants.</strong></p><p><strong>Ian\nDouglas Hamilton, Bhalla, S., Wittemyer, G. &amp; Vollrath, F.,\n\u201cBehavioural Reactions of Elephants Towards a Dying and Deceased\nMatriarch.\u201d Applied Animal Behaviour Science 100, (2006), 67-102. </strong></p><p><strong>c.\nSatan, demons and angels,</strong><strong>\nare creative, are moral, knowing the difference between right and\nwrong. And have the ability to choose good or bad. Does that mean\nthey are created in  the image of God?</strong></p><p><strong>d.\nWhat about people who are cognitively impaired. Those who have\nintellectual disabilities and restricted in the capacity to reason or\ndo not have the necessary moral facilities to build relationships are\nthey less than human.

Known as the Reich\nCommittee for the Scientific Treatment of Severe Hereditary and\nCongenital Diseases, the group was told to keep its mission secret.\nIn August 1939, committee members asked doctors and midwives to fill\nout a questionnaire that would identify children born with various\ndeformities or disabilities. Initially, the focus was on children\nunder the age of three. The committee claimed it was using the\ninformation \u201cto clarify certain scientific questions.\u201d In fact,\nit was used to determine which children would be allowed to live. The\ncommittee relied entirely on the questionnaires in making its\ndecisions. Members did not examine a single child, consult with other\nphysicians, or speak to the families involved. Once a decision was\nmade, the committee told the child\u2019s parents only that their baby\nwas being placed in a special hospital to \u201cimprove\u201d treatment.\nThere, death came quickly. After the war, a physician involved in the\nprogram told Robert Jay Lifton, an American psychiatrist, \u201cAccording\nto the thinking of that time, in the case of children, killing seemed\nsomehow justifiable whereas in the case of the adult mentally ill,\nthat was definitely murder.\u201d \u2018Unworthy to live,\u2019\u2019 Holocaust\nand human behaviour.

When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the\nright hand of the Majesty on high,<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2018Christ as the image\nof God is a reflection of God that demonstrates God\u2019s intentions\nfor all humanity. Christ illustrates God\u2019s purposes and goals for\nhumanity, Christ demonstrates who people can be. You could say that\nbeing created in the image of God give us the opportunity to reflect\nJesus\u2019 relationships with His father and with others. The image of\nGod in you gives you the potential of having an intimate relationship\nwith God. The image of God expresses God\u2019s ultimate desire for our\nlives and our greatest need.      </strong></p><p><strong>2.\nA proper understanding of the image of God will determine how we\ntreat others. </strong><strong>If\nGod created humans in His image, and every life has value, then we\ncannot ignore those trapped in poverty, trafficking, or homelessness.\nWe cannot ignore the widow or the orphan who bears the image of God.\nAs image bearers of God\u2014protector of strangers and helper of the\nfatherless and the widow (Ps. 146:9)</strong></p><p><strong>Has\nGod not told us \u2026</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>Open\nyour hand willingly to your poor and needy brother in your land\u201d\n(Deut 15:11).</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>Speak\nup for those who have no voice, for the justice of all who are\ndispossessed.

We allow people\u2019s\nsin and failure to define them.

It is important that we\nunderstand that no one\u2019s sin has any ability to devalue them. For\nexample if you were to get a coin with the kings head on it, if the\nimage of the kings head was faded, our even difficult to make out.\nWould that mean that particulate coin had lost some of it\u2019s value?\nNo of course not. Sin may diminish or fade the image of God in\nsomeone, but it will never eradicate it, or make that person less\nvaluable.

Not as lost\nsinners who deserved to be condemned.</strong></p><p><strong>According\nto James 3:9 to curse a person who is made in the image of God is\nwrong. Cursing people is the same as cursing God. When we damage and\ndishonour people we are doing the same to God. Conversely, treating\npeople well honours God. If dishonouring and mistreating people is an\nattack on God it is not surprising that Satan under the guise of the\nserpent attacked and deceived Adam and Eve.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe were to take a step back, and think about people in our lives who\nhave caused us pain.

For example if we were to ask you what you think\nand feel about holiness? Most people would think, \u2018Well it is\nsomething we have to do, but we get don\u2019t too excited about it.\u2019\nYet four times in the Old Testament 1Chron 16:29, 2Chron 20:21, Psalm\n29:2, 96:9, and in Hebrews 13:18, KJV we are told to \u2018Worship the\nLord in the beauty of holiness.\u2019 </strong></p><p><strong>The\nHebrew word for beauty [hadara] was a word used to describe clothing\nthat spoke of honour, majesty or glory. </strong></p><p><strong>You\ncould say that holiness is the opposite of toxic shame. Holiness\nbrings a sense of well-being and wholeness to a person. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nare however, continually tempted to live out of misunderstanding or\nour misrepresentation's of holiness to such an extent that we don\u2019t\nknow how to pursue it. </strong></p><p><strong>This\nmeans that we try other ways to cover our shame. For example, some\npeople feel the need to continually talk about themselves. Or they\nhave a desire to prove themselves, try desperately to medicate the\ndeep sense of shame or self loathing they may feel. However, for the\nfollower of Jesus, the only authentic cure for a life full of toxic\nshame is growth in holiness.   </strong></p><p><strong>We\nare repeatedly told \u2018Be holy for I am holy.\u2019 see Leviticus 11:44,\n11:45, 19:2, 20:26, 1 Peter 1:16. This reference is important for our\nunderstanding of holiness. </strong><strong>1\nPeter is a letter from Peter to the believers who had been dispersed\nthroughout the ancient world and who were under intense persecution.\nPeter wanted to comfort and encourage them. So one of the ways he\ndoes that is he tell them to be holy. </strong></p><p><strong>Try\nto put yourself in a situation where you are really struggling and\nlife is not easy and a friend comes along and one of the things they\nsay to you is \u2018be holy.\u2019 I reckon most of us would have a\nnegative reaction to this. However, there are reasons why this was\ngreat advice from Peter.</strong></p><p><strong>To\nbe holy means that you have been set apart for God.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nhave all experienced what it is like not to be picked for something,\nto be left on the side lines. To be holy is the recognition that God\nhas chosen you for himself.  Listen to these mind blowing words.\n\u2018Even before he made the world. God chose us in Christ to be holy\nand without blame in his eyes.\u2019 Ephesians 1:4. I think this verse\nis amazing. Before God made the universe his big plan for our lives\nis that we be holy.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe are under great pressure, how is the fact that we have been chosen\nby God going to make you feel?</strong></p><p><strong>To\nbe holy means that you will have the moral resources to respond\ncorrectly to the pressure you will face.</strong></p><p><strong>Many\nChristians face unbearable heart breaking situations, and for some it\nis too much and sadly they feel they have no choice but to walk away\nfrom God and their faith. We must never judge or condemn these\npeople, but we must ensure that we ourselves are growing in holiness,\nbecause we do not know what trials and temptations we may have to\nface in the future.  It is by growing in holiness that we will be\nbetter equipped to cope with them.   t</strong><strong>o\nbe holy is how we protect our identity and lives as authentic human\nbeings.</strong></p><p><strong>Very\noften when living under stressful circumstances we are inclined to\nmake compromises. We cease to be the people God wants us to be, and\nwe can develop a victim mindset, allowing the pain of life to define\nus. Being created in the image of God means that moral beauty of\nholiness needs to define us.</strong></p><p><strong>You\ncould even say that the word holy sums up all of God\u2019s intentions\nand plans for your life. Growing in holiness is how we discover the\npotential of being made in the image of God.  And yet we don\u2019t know\nhow to be enthusiastic about it or enjoy holiness. When we do not\nassociate holiness with joy, or beauty or abundant life, it will not\nbecome a priority.</strong></p><p><strong>But\nI think that there is an even more serious misunderstanding or\nmisinterpretation when it comes to our Christian experience. If we\nwere to ask what does it mean to become like Jesus, to really reflect\nthe image of God, what would you say?

This could not be further from the truth.</strong></p><p><strong>As\nchildren of God, we need to know the mind of Christ just as much as\nHe did.

If I am not thinking the way Jesus thinks then I will avoid\ncarrying my cross.  </strong></p><p><strong>3.To\nhave the same attitude as Jesus does not require great intellect,\ntheological knowledge or a capacity to understand everything, but it\ndoes require that our hearts embrace the same attitudes of Jesus. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nword attitude actually means a settled way of thinking; it is arrived\nat after careful thought.  Originally the word attitude was a\ntechnical term in art for the posture of a figure in a statue or\npainting. So having the attitude of Jesus needs to become a fixed way\nof thinking. </strong></p><p><strong>4.\nThe immediate context lets us know, that the specific attitude or\nmindset Paul is speaking about, is having a humble love for others.</strong></p><p><strong>Let\nus try and grasp the mindset that directed Jesus\u2019 life and destiny,\nand discover what it means to love God with our minds.</strong></p><p><strong>This\npassage has caused a lot of discussion and there are a lot of\ntechnical things that I am not qualified to go into. However there\nare a number of principles that we can learn and apply to our lives.</strong></p><p><strong>a.\nJesus was prepared to let go.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Who\nbeing in the very nature God did not consider equality with God\nsomething to be grasped.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>This\nsimply means He did not think of his status as something to be clung\nto or grasped. The Greek word harpagmos, (grasped) which means \"to\nsnatch, or to clutch, to take hold of or to keep hold of. T</strong><strong>he\nword refers to something that a person has in their possession but\nchooses not to use to their own advantage. </strong><strong>Jesus\ndid not feel the need to hold on to his position, power, or prestige.\nHe did not get his security from being in a place of prominence or\nauthority, but from his relationship with his father. The\nimplications of having this mindset are enormous. </strong></p><p><strong>Every\ntime we feel a need to hold onto a position of power, or every time\nwe feel a need to be seen to be in control in order to feel secure\nand fulfilled, we are opposing the attitudes that brought Jesus to\nearth and to the cross. Every time we demand our \u2018rights\u2019 and\ninsist that our value as a person is related to some legitimate\nposition we may have, we display a mindset that is the exact opposite\nto the mind of Christ. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nhave all known or experienced people who can\u2019t move on, who can\u2019t\nstep down. They may be involved in a church, or a ministry, or even\nin their job. And they are grasping to their position because it has\nbecome their source of identity and significance.  They are unable\nand unwilling to let go. </strong></p><p><strong>As\nwe have said the word harpagmos carries the idea of keeping hold of\nsomething, but, it has a second meaning that may deepen our\nunderstanding. The word was used to describe something seized through\nrobbery. When a thief steals something, their focus is usually on\nthemselves, with no or little regard for others. This is the same\nheart attitude of someone who is unable or unwilling to let go of a\nposition of of prestige.    </strong></p><p><strong>People\nin Christian ministry can live with an inflated sense of\nself-importance and an insatiable drive to be liked and to be at the\ncentre of attention. Satan will capitalize on these traits and tempt\nthem to compromise their morals and values.

Being a\ndoulos involved the losing of one\u2019s own autonomy and the\nsubordination of one\u2019s will to another.  </strong></p><p><strong>The\nGreeks felt only revulsion and contempt for the position of a slave. \nBy law the slave was classed with immobile goods, had no rights at\nlaw and could not own property.  Even his family did not belong to\nhim; he was the property of the master.  In Rabbinic literature the\nword slave constitutes one of the worst insults one man can hurl at\nanother; it was not for nothing that a man might be excommunicated\nfor calling his neighbour a slave\u201d </strong></p><p><strong>Johh\nMcAuthur says \u2018They had no choice about anything. They owned\nnothing. They couldn\u2019t be citizens and they couldn\u2019t be a part of\nthe army or the military. They were totally dependent on whoever\nowned them. It doesn\u2019t mean that they didn\u2019t have some benefits.\nThey were provided for, cared for and protected. In many cases,\ntreated kindly, compassionately, some even loved within families. But\nto the Greek and the Roman philosophically and socially, freedom was\nthe pinnacle of life. So free men had only scorn for slaves and\nslaves longed to be free.\u2019 The difference between a slave and a\nservant in Greek/Roman culture was very stark. Servants were hired\nworkers who were paid. Slaves were not hired but owned. Servants\ncould quit if they desired, a slave could only leave his master after\n30 years, if he wanted to. Servants could have more than one job; a\nslave solely served the interest of his master. This is so counter\ncultural, having a mindset of a slave. Yet for Jesus it was a natural\nand honest expression of who he was. For Jesus living a life with the\nheart of a slave was primarily an expression of deep security.\nhttps://www.gty.org/sermons/80-321/slaves-for-christ.</strong></p><p><strong>Listen\nto these words.</strong></p><p>\u2019<strong>Jesus\nknew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he\nhad come from God and was returning to God; so he got up from the\nmeal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his\nwaist.\u2019</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>In\nbecoming a slave, Jesus was focusing his life; He was saying that as\na son, he wanted to live exclusively for the will of his father, like\na slave lived for his master. In having the nature of a slave he was\npermanently binding himself to the purposes of God and the needs of\npeople.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you there is great freedom in being your slave</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> .

In English, the word \"to obey\" simply\nmeans to comply with an instruction, rule, law, etc. But in the\nGreek, hypkeoos (which is only found three times in the bible,)\nactually means to listen and respond. There is both a listening and a\nresponding that is included, much like answering a doorbell or a\nphone.  In other words, obedience for Jesus was rooted in and\nresponding to his Fellowship with his father. For Jesus, obedience\nwas only possible in the context of fellowship. (Maybe doing the\nright thing while out of fellowship with God is really a subtle form\nof disobedience.) Authentic obedience can only be expressed in the\ncontext of fellowship with God.</strong></p><p><strong>f.\nJesus was obedient to death.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\naccepted that suffering was an unavoidable part of a life that was\ntotally committed to God and his purposes. Jesus was obedient to\ndeath, even death on a cross! The Romans reserved the agonizing death\nof crucifixion for slaves and foreigners, and the Jews viewed death\non a cross as a curse from God. We have become too familiar with the\nterm \u2018cross.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>\"It\nis difficult after sixteen centuries and more, during which the cross\nhas been a sacred symbol, to realize the unspeakable horror and\nloathing which the very mention or thought of the cross provoked in\nPaul's day.

To be unashamed is to feel totally accepted. The\nHebrew for shame is bawsh which has a root that means \"to pale\"\n(for example, when the blood drains from your face).  It is referring\nto feeling of being uncomfortable, not at ease, feeling unworthy and\nunaccepted.  The dictionary definition of shame goes something like\nthis: Shame is the painful emotion caused by a consciousness of guilt\nor shortcoming or impropriety.

Shame at it\u2019s essence is inverted pride and\ncovert narcissism.

The removal\nof our guilt is known as justification. The minute we became a\nChristian we were completely forgiven, there was no more\ncondemnation. Justification is a judicial term, it describes how God\nsees us. Sanctification, on the other hand deals more with our\nexperience of shame.</strong></p><p><strong>Shame\nis so rooted in our thinking that it requires the growth of\ntransformed thinking and a maturing self-perspective caused by\nspiritual transformation to live free from its power. We all want a\n\u2018\u2019magic bullet\u2019 a \u2018super spiritual experience\u2019 to remove\nour feelings of shame, because we are not aware that the removal of\nour feelings of shame is tied to our spiritual growth. The tragic\nthing is this, often the church has been guilty of turning shame into\na motivating virtue. So it has been used to coerce, control and\nmanipulate to get people to serve.  In an essay on shame in the\nchurch at  Dan Foster wrote:-</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Shame\nis used in the church to make people conform to the norms of the\ngroup. Belief, in any system, is a social exercise. Nowhere is this\nmore evident than in the evangelical church. If you want to fit in,\nthere are a bunch of so-called, not-negotiable \u201ctruths\u201d that you\nmust ascribe to. Many of them are extra-Biblical and have more to do\nwith tradition and dogma than the actual practice of following\nChrist.</strong></p><p><strong>Guilt-based\nreligion and shame work well to keep the troops in line because shame\ncertainly is a powerful motivator \u2014 but only in the short term. It\ndoes not result in real, lasting transformation. A system that uses\nshame to achieve its goals ultimately makes out God to be the same.\nUnwittingly, the church made God seem like an arm-folding,\neye-rolling, head-shaking, fist-waving, disapproving megalomaniac,\nwho is impossible to please and constantly unimpressed. Moreover, the\nchurch made it seem like God, with a heaving sigh, begrudgingly came\nand died for our sins, and we ought to feel constantly guilty about\nmaking him die in the first place.\u2019 </strong><strong>Now\nhere is the big take away. If we are living out of shame, then our\ndefault will be to use shame in the lives of others in an attempt to\naccomplish God\u2019s will for our lives, turning shame into a \u2018virtue.\u2019\nThis, for the most part will not be a conscious decision, but has\nmore to do with immaturity and a lack of spiritual growth. As\nChristians we cannot become so accustomed to living with shame or\neven living out of shame. Shame is the antithesis to the image of God\nand in order that we become more like Jesus, we need the grace of God\nto deliver us from our shame and it\u2019s power in our lives.\u2019 Father\ndeliver me pervasive effects of shame.\u2019\n</strong><u><a href=\"https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/the-church-needs-shame-to-function/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/the-church-needs-shame-to-function/</strong></a></u><strong>.\n</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Hosea 10-14 Joel 1:1-2:17</p>",

I feel very sad. I have a friend who was a great bible\nteacher, and God used him all over the world, now he is very far from\nGod.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsecond emotion I feel is fear, fear of not ending the race well. I\noften wonder, will I be faithful to the end? Will I remain faithful\nby growing in faithfulness? Or will I end with a cold tired heart\nthat has forgotten how to be passionate about Jesus? How we will\ncross the line is more important than when we started. We have no\ncontrol as to when we will cross the finishing line, but we are\nabsolutely responsible for how we cross it so let us look at some\nverses that will help us finish well.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nGalatians 6:6-10 Paul wrote these words \u2018Nevertheless, the one who\nreceives instruction in the word should share all good things with\ntheir instructor. 7 Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man\nreaps what he sows. 8 Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the\nflesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from\nthe Spirit will reap eternal life. 9 Let us not become weary in doing\ngood, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give\nup. 10 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all\npeople, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>Paul\n\tgives us five areas of relationships where we need to be\n\tintentional, where we need to work hard at sowing that will produce\n\ta harvest of eternal life. Before we look at this we need to first\n\tconsider the principle of sowing and reaping.</strong></p><p><strong>Madame\n\tChiang Kai-shek once wrote: \"If the past has taught us anything\n\tit is that every cause brings its effect, every action has a\n\tconsequence. We Chinese have a saying: \"If a man plants melons\n\the will reap melons; if he sows beans, he will reap beans.\" And\n\tthis is true of everyone's life; good begets good, and evil leads to\n\tevil. True enough, the sun shines on the saint and the sinner alike,\n\tand too often it seems that the wicked prosper. But we can say with\n\tcertainty that, with the individual as with the nation, the\n\tflourishing of the wicked is an illusion, for, unceasingly, life\n\tkeeps books on us all. In the end, we are all the sum total of our\n\tactions. Character cannot be counterfeited, nor can it put on and\n\tcast off as if it were a garment to meet the whim of the moment.\n\tLike the markings on wood which are ingrained in the very heart of\n\tthe tree, character requires time and nurturing for growth and\n\tdevelopment. Thus also, day by day, we write our own destiny; for\n\tinexorably...we become what we do.\"\n\t</strong><a href=\"https://www.ccel.org/contrib/exec_outlines/gal/ga6_7.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>https://www.ccel.org/contrib/exec_outlines/gal/ga6_7.htm</strong></a><strong>.\n\t Accessed 04/08/25</strong></p><p><strong>Let\n\tme try and explain the implications of this principle.</strong></p><p><strong>[a]\n\tA harvest may be sown in secret but the harvest itself cannot be\n\thidden.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nis so important. The seeds we sow in private will eventually become\nevident. In some ways the people we are and the things we do when\nnobody but God sees us, is when we sow prominent seeds that will have\na massive influence on who we will become in the future. </strong></p><p><strong>[b]\nWe alone are responsible for the seed we sow. Nobody else can sow our\nseed. Your seeds are your seeds, we cannot hold other people\nresponsible for the people we become. Do others influence and effect\nus, yes. But no matter how I have been treated or mistreated by\nothers, the harvest I will reap and the character I become is due to\nthe seeds I am/have sowed. </strong></p><p><strong>[b]\n\tTime might pass before the harvest ripens but it will come.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nharvest will take time, be it a good harvest or a bad harvest it will\ncome, That is both good news and bad news. I have been with people\nwho have sown good seed and as they were dying their was a dignified\ncomposer about them. Conversely, others who have planted poor/bad\nseed all their lives have been bitter and agitated as they have faced\ndeath.   </strong></p><p><strong>[c]\n\tThe nature of the seed we sow will determine the harvest.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe sow good seed like love, mercy, compassion, kindness and the like\nwe can expect a good harvest. That is sowing to the Spirit. However,\nif we are sowing seed that is consistent with our sinful nature then\nwe should expect to develop a character that is inconsistent with the\nimage and purposes of God.</strong></p><p><strong>[d]\nThe harvest will always be greater/more than the seed that you sow.\nThe seeds we sow may seem to be small, like attitudes, thoughts,\nperceptions, prestiges. Seeds are almost inconsequential, they are so\nsmall, however, the size of the seed will not determine the size of\nthe plant it will produce.</strong></p><p><strong>[e]\nYou can do nothing about your past harvests but you can about future\nharvests. The harvest we reaped in the future does not have to be the\nsame as the harvest we have reaped in the past. We can easily think,\n\u2018if my circumstances are different in the future then I will be a\nbetter/happier person.  The problem is, our circumstances do not\ndetermine the harvest we will reap in our characters. We can move\nhomes, change our jobs, get married, but if we are sowing the seeds\nyou have always sown, then nothing in you is going to change. </strong></p><p><strong>[g]\nThe sowing and reaping principle applies to every area of our lives.\nWhen we sow seed we sow it in every single area of our lives, there\nis nothing in our lives immune from the sowing and reaping principle.\n\u2018I wonder will we make it?\u2019 </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me be intentional in sowing good seed.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> .

We need to be people that longs to learn.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nfirst relationship that Paul talks about is the relationship between\nthose who teach the word of God and those who are taught.  Galatians\n6:6. </strong><strong>\nNevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should\nshare all good things with their instructor. </strong><strong>As\nChristians we should always have a teachable attitude. If someone at\nschool engages well with a teacher, they are probably going to enjoy\nthe class more and perhaps learn more. This same principle applies to\nthe church. The question is, are we teachable? What does it mean to\nbe teachable? To help us grasp what Paul is saying there are two\nwords that he uses that may help us.</strong></p><p><strong>[a]\nThe first word for teach </strong><em><strong>kat\u0113che\u014d</strong></em><strong>,\nwhich was used in the sense of reporting something to another or to\ninstruct someone, it was used to described an actor speaking down\nfrom a stage, and it is where our word echo is derived from. Paul\nuses it four times and uses it exclusively to refer to instructing\nsomeone in the Christian faith (1 Cor 14:19; Gal 6:6 [2x]; Rom 2:18).\nIt is from this word that we get our word catechism. </strong><strong>a\nsummary of the principles of Christian religion in the form of\nquestions and answers, used for religious instruction. So we need to\nbe people who have continual eagerness to learn truth that will\ndefine our lives. </strong><strong>Can\nI just say that being teachable is a choice, it is an intentional\nattitude, a deliberate mindset. </strong></p><p><strong>Let\n\tus take a step back and think about this. How do we listen to\n\tteaching from the word of God, what frame of mind do we have as we\n\tsit listening to sermons every week?  We can either sit and be and\n\tnot be engaged, thinking about lots of other things, or, we can sit\n\twith a teachable heart, longing to learn about God and ourselves.</strong></p><p><strong>[b]\n\tThe second word Paul uses is koinoneo which means to share, not to\n\timpart but share, to have things in common, to hold in common, the\n\tword was used as business partners. Paul is saying that learning is\n\ta corporate experience, where we choose to invest in order to learn.\n\t  The focus of this verse is the quality of the relationship between\n\tthe teacher and those he is teaching. We need to be personally and\n\tproactively be investing some of our resources so we can have more\n\topportunity to learn about God and know him better.</strong></p><p><strong>Ca\nI just say in passing that I have Learned that for some people being\nin bible collage can be a very dangerous place, because they are\ncontinually being taught, they are continually receiving information.\nLooking back a my own experience at bible college no one ever told me\nthat the primary purpose, the ultimate goal, the most important and\nessential objective of being at bible college, was not to prepare for\nministry. Was not to get to know the bible better. It wasn't even to\nhelp me discern God\u2019s future purposes for my life.  All these are\nimportant and good, but they are not, nor ever should they be the\npurpose of bible college.  The ultimate objective of being at any \nbible college,  is to get to know God.</strong></p><p><strong>For\nthe Christian learning to know God for the most part will be a\npainful and difficult experience, because it will require all our\nfalse and wrong understandings about God [which often feel like\ntruth,] to be demolished. It may require a deconstruction of some of\nour theology in order to build a more biblical theology that is more\nconsistent with who God really is.</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>How\ndo you know if you are teachable? </strong></p><p><strong>You\nlearn from anyone and everyone you can.</strong></p><p><strong>You\nlisten to others carefully and patiently with a desire to learn from\neveryone you read widely especially outside your theological comfort\nzone.</strong></p><p><strong>You\u2019re\nprepared to move out of your comfort zone, try something different,\nmake mistakes, look stupid, answer wrongly, etc.</strong></p><p><strong>You\ndon\u2019t give up when you fail at something, but seek help, and try\nagain and again until you get it right.</strong></p><p><strong>You\nare willing to change your views and practices when convincing\nevidence is presented to you, even if it means admitting you were\nwrong</strong><strong>.\n</strong><strong>Father\nthank you that life is being enrolled in a life long classroom. </strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>Bible\nin a year reading plan.

    "html": "<p><strong>Paul\ngives three reasons why we should sow to the spirit</strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe are not sowing to the Spirit then we are sowing to the\nflesh/sinful nature. John Stott said this: -</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>\u2018</strong><strong>To\n\"sow to the flesh\" is to pander to it, to cosset, cuddle\nand stroke it, instead of crucifying it. The seeds we sow are largely\nthoughts and deeds. Every time we allow our mind to harbour a grudge,\nnurse a grievance, entertain an impure fantasy, or wallow in\nself-pity, we are sowing to the flesh. Every time we linger in bad\ncompany whose insidious influence we know we cannot resist, every\ntime we lie in bed when we ought to be up and praying, every time we\nread pornographic literature, every time we take a risk that strains\nour self-control, we are sowing, sowing, sowing to the flesh.\u2019</strong><strong>\n</strong>\u201cThe\nMessage of Galatians\u201d p. 170.</p><p><strong>Gordon\nFee gives this definition for the flesh.\u201dThe flesh is the condition\nof humanity \u201cbefore and outside of Christ.\u201d To walk in the flesh\nis to walk on our own, outside of Christ\u2019s redemptive work, outside\nof the power of the Holy Spirit.\n</strong><u><a href=\"https://www.fairlyspiritual.org/2011/02/21/live-according-to-the-spirit-not-according-to-the-flesh/https://www.fairlyspiritual.org/2011/02/21/live-according-to-the-spirit-not-according-to-the-flesh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>https://www.fairlyspiritual.org/2011/02/21/live-according-to-the-spirit-not-according-to-the-flesh/https://www.fairlyspiritual.org/2011/02/21/live-according-to-the-spirit-not-according-to-the-flesh/</strong></a></u><strong>\n  access 14/03/2025</strong></p><p><strong>Whether\nwe do seemingly noble things or incredibly \u201cwicked\u201d things, if\nthey are done outside of relationship with God, they are done in the\nflesh.</strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>Robert\nJewett defines \"the flesh\" in Galatians 5 and 6 as \"Paul's\nterm for everything aside from God in which one places his final\ntrust.\u2019 source unknown.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>The\nflesh is the conviction that I am the most important thing in the\nuniverse. It is ultimately worship of myself\u2014 my pleasure, my\nexaltation, my success, my reputation. I will defend myself against,\nexalt myself over, prefer myself to any and every other person. There\nis an enormously self-centred core in me. Even self-destructive\nbehaviour is an expression of personal power. If God says he loves\nme, I\u2019ll destroy what he loves, to prove my superiority.\u2019 Steve\nZeisler. https://cdn.pbc.org/Main_Service/2000/10/08/4690.pdf</strong></p><p><strong>In\nFreudian terminology you could say that the flesh was like the \u2018Id\u2019\n</strong></p><p><strong>The\nid seeks instant gratification for our wants and needs. If these\nneeds or wants are not met, a person can become tense, anxious, or\nangry.  For example, Bart was stuck in traffic. He just wanted his\nvehicle to move! Enraged at the situation, Bart pulled his car onto\nthe shoulder and sped forward, not caring that he was clipping\npeople's side mirrors as he tried to get ahead of the cars in front\nof him.</strong></p><p><strong>At\nit\u2019s essence our struggle with our flesh is always an identity\nissue. It is rooted in a wrong belief that what we have in Jesus is\nnot enough so we develop a desire for independence from God, in order\nto quickly satisfy our present longings. The direction and trajectory\nof the flesh is always independence from God.</strong></p><p><strong>[b]\nWhen we are not sowing to the Spirit then we are deceiving ourselves\nand mocking God. </strong></p><p><strong>We\ncan very easily deceive ourselves, sometimes we refuse to be honest\nwith ourselves. We can go into performance mode in order to hide from\nourselves. If everyone else thinks I am OK, then I must be!  </strong></p><p><strong>To\nmock God, Greek word muckerizo, it carries the ides that we do not\ntake what God is saying seriously. We think, it does not matter how I\nlive, God cannot be serious, </strong><strong>The\nverb he employs means literally \u201cto turn up the nose\u201d so as to\ntreat with contempt. \u201cIn a culture where face and honour and shame\nwas very important, to turn up one\u2019s nose at someone was to shame\nthem, it was to treat them as someone weak, as someone beneath </strong><strong>one\u2019s\nown dignity, and as unworthy of one\u2019s respect\u201d (Witherington,\n431).</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>The\nreference is not to verbal scoffing but to despising God by a whole\nway of life.</strong></p><p><strong>[c]\nNot to sow to the Spirit is to guarantee destruction.  The word used\nfor destruction is</strong><strong>\nphthora, this is not a sudden destruction owing to external violence,\nbut a dissolution brought about by internal decay. It describes\ndecomposition which brings to mind the picture of loathsome decaying\nmatter replete with maggots and other macabre microbes! Figuratively\nspeaking the idea is that of the horrible thought of the \"rotting\"\nof one's morals which become more depraved with greater loss of\nintegrity as a result of \"slow internal decay\".</strong></p><p><strong>On\nthe other hand, to sow to the Spirit is to live a life that is\nsurrendered to the Spirit. In chapter five Paul uses four verbs to\ndescribe our relationship with the Spirit. \u2018Walk by the Spirit,\u2019\n\u2018Led by the Spirit.\u2019 \u2018Live by the Spirit.\u2019 and \u2018keep in\nstep with the Spirit.\u2019 These words carry the idea of surrender, or\nsubmitting, holding lightly to our agendas, or plans, being open and\nflexible to go where the Spirit leads.  It is important to recognise\nthat when the bible talks about being led by the Spirit it is\nprimarily talking about being led into transformation. The context of\nPaul\u2019s teaching about being led by the Spirit is usually in the\ncontext of him talking about a Christian character and our\ntransformation into the likeness of Jesus.   To be led by the Spirit\nis to be led out of shame into grace, from guilt into freedom. from\ninsecurity into the glorious love of God. To sow to the Spirit is to\nlive a life that is continually in every circumstance displaying the\nfruit of the Spirit. no matter where or who we are with, or what we\nare doing, we recognise that the fruit of the Spirit is both\nappropriate and essential for that time. Father thank you there is no\nsituation or circumstance in life where the fruit oft the Spirit is\nnot essential.  </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> . Obadiah</p>",

We can lose our vision, our\n\tpurpose, our enthusiasm and drive and before long we have ceased to\n\tsow the good seed that is consistent with living a godly life.  </strong></p><p><strong>4.\n\tSeeds of love. We need to be people that does good to all.</strong></p><p><strong>Paul\n\tends this section by giving two general principles for sowing good\n\tseed.</strong></p><p><strong>[a]\n\t</strong><strong>Therefore,\n\tas we have opportunity, let us do good to all people.  Three times\n\tin these verses Paul uses the word good.  </strong><strong>The\n\tword \u201call,\u201d pas, means all, to each and every person. regardless\n\tof who or what they are; it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re\n\tprotestant, it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re Catholic, it doesn\u2019t\n\tmatter if they\u2019re Muslim, it doesn\u2019t matter.  You do good to all\n\tmen, regardless of any prejudice, regardless of whether they\u2019re\n\tbelievers or unbelievers. It doesn\u2019t matter; you do good to all\n\tmen. Maybe making the most out of life is about seeing it as a\n\tcontinual opportunity to do good to others. Imagine going into life\n\twith that attitude. The goodness that Paul is referring to is based\n\tupon a person\u2019s character, it is a spontaneous expression of who\n\tthey are.</strong></p><p><strong>5.\n\tSeeds of responsibility, </strong><strong>especially\n\tto those who belong to the family of believers. Galatians 6:10,\n\t</strong><strong>Therefore,\n\tas we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to\n\tthose who belong to the family of believers.<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<br/></p><p><strong>We\n\thave </strong><strong>responsibility\n\tto the family of God. The word for family oikeios, refers to all the\n\tparticipants of a particular family. It carries the idea of\n\tbelonging to a place of safety. If we are going to be an authentic\n\texpression of the life of God, then our lives must become a safe\n\tplace for others. If we recognise others as part of our family, then\n\twe are going to be proactive in sowing seed that will produce life. \n\t</strong><strong>We\n\tneed to be people who demonstrate continual care for others.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Sowing\nto please the Spirit means \"serving one another in love\"\n(5:13), restoring one who has been caught in sin (6:1), carrying the\nburdens of others (6:2), giving generously to those who teach in the\nchurch (6:6) and doing good to all (6:9). Sometimes sowing to the\nSpirit has been defined in terms of private, personal holiness, as if\nit were something done in a closet by oneself. But sowing to the\nSpirit in the context of Paul's teaching here involves building love\nrelationships with others. Sowing to the Spirit cannot be done in\nisolation or separation from others. Carrying the burdens of others\nrequires in-depth participation in their pain and sorrow. As we see\nin verse 9, sowing to the Spirit means </strong><em><strong>doing\ngood</strong></em><em><strong>\n</strong></em><strong>to\nothers. If sowing to the sinful nature means selfish indulgence, then\nsowing to the Spirit means selfless service.</strong><strong>\nIVP Commentary</strong></p><p><strong>Every\n\tone of us are people of potential, there are lots of things we\n\tcannot do, control, or change, often circumstances are beyond our\n\tability to do anything about, but the one thing we are all\n\tresponsible for is the people we are becoming, the character we are\n\tdeveloping into. In our passage, Paul promises that if we sow to the\n\tSpirit we will reap eternal life.  We often make the mistake in\n\tthinking that when the bible speaks about eternal life it is talking\n\tabout life in heaven, but it\u2019s not. Eternal life is best\n\tunderstood as experiencing the very life of God in the present, it\n\thas more to do with the quality of our lives, than its longevity.\n\tThe longevity of eternal life is only part of its quality, but it is\n\tnot its essence.   Eternal life is the reality life of God in the\n\there and now.

Sometimes in life we get weary, tired, burned out. To be weary is to feel empty of a fighting spirit, to cease to fight for what is right, to become exhausted as a result of giving in to evil. - literally, \u201cLet us not keep on giving in to evil while doing the good.\" Paul is telling us to keep on doing good, even if you feel that you are wasting your time, or if you feel that it is pointless. To sow good seed is to, keep on doing good in the face of evil and opposition, because good seed will produce a good harvest. Sometimes we become tired, we lose perspective, and we give into feelings of discouragement."

The service these women gave to Jesus came out\nof their healing. They served not because they felt guilty, not\nbecause they wanted some kind of payback, not because they were\nlooking for approval or status, but because they were cured. For\nthese women the choosing of the narrow road of discipleship was the\nconsequences of the healing power of God in their lives.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nraises a question?

Why? Because he wanted to\nteach us how to be human, he wanted to show the glorious essence of\nour humanity. Let me explain. Jesus had a God given ability to do the\nmiraculous, he was able to feed over 5000 people with 5 small loafs\nand 2 fish. But he never used his divine power to meet his own needs,\nhe never turned stone into bread.   </strong></p><p><strong>It\nwas as if Jesus as a perfect man valued the relationships of\ndependence more than independence.

Sometimes people can become so dehumanised by their\npride they are unable to receive from others. You often hear people\nsay something like \u2018I am not a charity case.\u2019 you know what, we\nare all charity cases. We all need the support, love and grace of\nothers.

Entirely on their own, they\nurgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service\nto the Lord\u2019s people. And they exceeded our expectations: They gave\nthemselves first of all to the Lord, and then by the will of God also\nto us. So we urged Titus, just as he had earlier made a beginning, to\nbring also to completion this act of grace on your part. But since\nyou excel in everything\u2014in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in\ncomplete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you\u2014see\nthat you also excel in this grace of giving. </strong><strong>I\nam not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love\nby comparing it with the earnestness of others.

You could even say that the giving and\nreceiving components of generosity are more the consequences or the\nfruit of generosity. </strong></p><p><strong>Generosity\nis first and foremost a deep rooted characteristic that should be the\ndistinguishing feature of people who are known as Christians.\nGenerosity is the essence of community. A group of people cannot\nbecome a community of God if generosity is not a tangible growing\nreality. So we want to explore an example of generosity from the\nbible and try and grasp what it really is.   </strong></p><p><strong>2\nCorinthians 8-9 is probably the best exposition of generosity you are\never going to come across. Before we look at these verses we need to\nsay a few things</strong></p><p><strong>Paul\nis using the Macedonian churches (Philippi and Thessalonica) as an\nexample to encourage the church in Corinth to continue to collect\nmoney for the poor in Jerusalem. The Christians in Jerusalem had\nsuffered greatly. They were ostracized by their communities which\nmeant that they lost all opportunity to sell their goods or trade;\nthey were also prohibited from buying everyday things like food,\nclothing, and other essentials. Their problem was made worse by a\nsevere famine that had devastated the whole area of Judea.</strong></p><p><strong>Paul\nis not using the example of the Macedonian churches to make the\nChristians in Corinth feel guilty or ashamed. Rather he wanted them\nto see how the power of grace leads to authentic generosity. The\nChristians in Macedonia lived in extreme poverty, but they gave, and\ngave.  Often in church circles guilt is the chief fund raiser. People\nuse this passage, and they misuse story of the widow\u2019s mite to\nwrongly motivate people. When Jesus saw this poor widow given all she\nhad in Mark 12:41-43 he was so appalled and disgusted by such a\nreligious system that abused the vulnerable he never went back to the\ntemple after that.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nthe translators translated 2 Corinthians 8-9 they used the word\ngenerous to translate two very different Greek words. The first word\nis </strong><em><strong>Haplot\u0113s</strong></em><strong>\nwhich means arising out of purity of mind\u201d. In other words, this\n\u2018giving\u2019 to those in need arose from pure intentions. See 2 Cor\n8:1, 9:11 9:13. It could be understood as focused. </strong></p><p><strong>I\ndon\u2019t think God wants our generosity to be expressed in the same\nway we pay tax. There needs to be intentionality about generosity.  </strong></p><p><strong>The\nsecond word </strong><em><strong>eulogia</strong></em><em><strong>\nmeans to bless, to praise or celebrate. These two words are two sides\nof the same \u2018coin.\u2019  The first word describes the character of\nthe generous person, while the second word describes the effect on\nothers a generous person has.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Remember\nthe point of this passage is to encourage the Church in Corinth to\ncare for the poor Christians in Jerusalem. It seems that in his word\n</strong></em><strong>God\nencourages voluntary giving for his work, but compulsory giving to\nthe poor. In the New Testament Christians are encouraged to give to\nthe poor see Matthew 5:42 Acts 20:35, Romans 12:13, Galatians 2:9-10,\nEphesians 4:28, Hebrews 13:16, James 1:27. They are also told that\nthey should provide for those who teach Galatians 6:6, 1Timothy\n5:17-18 1Corinthians 9:1-14. If you read this passage carefully it is\ninteresting what is not said. Using the Church of Macedonia as an\nexample of generosity Paul says nothing what so ever about how much\nthey gave, it seems that the amount they gave was irrelevant.  </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay generosity be an indicator you are changing my heart.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Matthew 5-7</p>",

When we allow the grace of God to transform our hearts our\nwhole perspective about ourselves and our world view are completely\nchanged. We discover a truth that we had never known be fore.</strong></p><p><strong>We\ndiscover that we are completely loved. No matter what we do, or don\u2019t\ndo God will always love us. This love produces in us a deep feeling\nof security.</strong></p><p><strong>We\ndiscover that the things we possess and the things we achieve can\nnever add value to us as people. This is really important, because we\nhold on tight to things and positions because we believe that these\nthings are an integral part of our value as people.</strong></p><p><strong>We\ndiscover that all people are worth loving because we are people made\nin the image of God</strong></p><p><strong>They\ngave despite their own pain. \u2018Out of the most severe trial.\u2019</strong><strong>\n The word \u201caffliction\u201d \u2018severe trial\u2019 (THLIPSIS) in the Greek\nliterally refers to pressure as</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>in\ncrushing grapes. Figuratively, in light of this context it would\ndescribe the extreme pressure the Macedonians were under while\nengaging in their generous giving. Paul does not say what the trial\nis he is referring to but we do know from other scriptures that the\nchurches in Macedonia were persecuted.</strong></p><p>\u201c<strong>For\nyou, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ\nJesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at\nthe hands of your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews, who\nboth killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out.\u201d So,\nwhat was the nature of the ordeal that was afflicting the churches of\nMacedonia? The Macedonian believers were being persecuted by their\nown countrymen in a similar manner as their Jewish brethren in Judea\nhad been persecuted by their countrymen (1 Thessalonians 2:14-15.)</strong></p><p><strong>These\nbelievers were in the most severe trial despite being filled with the\ngrace of God. The grace of God is not a panacea for all our problems.\nIt will not take away all our trouble, but it will help us to respond\nto others in a healthy manner without becoming bitter, angry or\nselfish. </strong></p><p><strong>They\ngave out of overflowing joy. </strong><strong>They\ngave out of hearts that were filled with joy.  Joy is more than an\nemotion, it is proof of spiritual growth and maturity. It is not the\nconsequence of circumstances; rather it is the result of the fruit of\nthe Spirit growing in someone\u2019s life. See Galatians 5:22. The best\nway to understand this kind of Joy is to </strong><strong>realise</strong><strong>\nthat the opposite of this Joy is not sadness but hopelessness.  I\nthink it would be difficult to be mean spirited and have joy in your\nheart at the same time. Joy breaks down the walls that separate\npeople, it empowers people to see beyond themselves and take the\nneeds of others seriously. </strong></p><p><strong>It\nis interesting to note that Jesus spoke most about his own joy on the\nnight before his cruel death on the cross than at any other time.</strong><strong>\nThe word Paul uses for joy comes from the word that means grace.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me understand that generosity has nothing to do with\ncircumstances or bank balance.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Matthew 8:1-10:15</p>",

The extravagant, uncontainable generosity of\nGod erupted out of their lives; it was a spontaneous expression of\nthe ongoing work of God in their hearts. This is so freeing, because\nguilt and shame could never reproduce this kind of generosity. Guilt\nmotivated generosity is like trying to feed the hungry with stale\nbread. Guilt defiles or soils generosity, it robs it of its glory or\nbeauty, making it into a subtle expression of selfishness.</strong></p><p><strong>Their\ngenerosity to others was consistent with giving themselves to the\nLord. \u2018They did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves\nfirst to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God\u2019s will.\u2019 Let\nme ask us this question, when did you last give yourself to the Lord?\n I am not talking about conversion, but the continual ongoing giving\nyourself to him.   </strong></p><p><strong>Every\none of us has opportunities and a need to live generous lives.

In the mind of Jesus this was\nperverted thinking. I think, that people, who struggle with accepting\nthemselves, feeling crushed by a low self-image, will often pursue a\nmaterialistic lifestyle, believing it will add value to them as\npeople.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nexposes the folly of this thinking by giving three word pictures.</strong></p><p><strong>Moth\neaten clothes.</strong><u><strong>\n</strong></u></p><p><strong>Most\nof the garments that were prized in Jesus' day were made out of wool,\nwhich was expensive. If a person invested a large portion of their\nmoney and wealth in the accumulation of woollen garments or cloth,\nthey ran a risk of it being destroyed.

It was where he could be himself,\nwhere he knew what to do and how to do it. His boat was his badge of\ncompetence, his sphere of proficiency, a representation of his\nexpertise. Getting into Peter\u2019s boat was Jesus\u2019 way of getting to\nthe very heart Peter.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsecond thing that Jesus did was to teach Peter that his work in\nPeter\u2019s life could not be confined or defined by Peter\u2019s\nunderstanding or experience. Everything that Jesus asked Peter to do\nwas contrary to all Peter\u2019s training, understanding and experience\nas a professional fisherman. To go out onto the lake in the middle of\nthe day with the hope of catching fish was a waste of time and\nenergy. </strong></p><p><strong>Peter\nwas going to learn that Jesus has the ability and the right to work\noutside the normal confines of the conventional. Neither Jesus nor\nhis dealings with us can be boxed, neatly packaged or conveniently\npigeon-holed, by the limitations of our understanding or experience. </strong></p><p><strong>As\nthe tons of fish began to enter Peter\u2019s nets, it dawned on Peter\nthat Jesus had not only the power to heal people and exorcise demons,\nbut he had control over the whole of creation, even the allusive fish\nthat Peter and his friends were unable to net on the previous night.\nIn verse 8 Peter refers to Jesus as Lord which means authoritative\nownership. His evaluation and understanding of who Jesus was\nunderwent a substantial change from master to Lord.    In doing so he\nwas giving him the supreme place in his life; he was pledging him\nimplicit obedience and reverent worship..</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay I know Jesus as my Lord</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Mark 1-3</p>",

This seems to have taken place relatively\nprivately, and the challenge comes from someone who poses relatively\nlittle threat, a young girl with little power. The form of her\nquestion is hesitant, using a form of words that expects a negative\nanswer, which makes it easier for Peter to deny than affirm. Peter\ntakes the route the questioner steered him towards, and denies it,\nwith each writer giving a different expression to his denial.</strong></p><p><strong>His\nsecond challenge</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsecond challenge, in a very similar form but in a more public\ncontext, comes from the same maid (Luke), another maid (Matt, Mark),\nor from the general company around the fire (John). One may imagine\nthat these accounts represent a coherent story, with the girl who\nchallenged him before, starting the challenge and the men around her\nthen following it up. This was a more pressured situation than the\nfirst challenge. Peter denies Jesus again, Mark adding that the\ndenial was with an oath.</strong></p><p><strong>Third\nchallenge</strong></p><p><strong>A\nman in the courtyard makes the third challenge, and is far more\nimmediately threatening to Peter\u2019s personal safety. Note how the\ntemptations have become ever more difficult to handle.  Matthew Mark\nand Luke say the challenge is that Peter is a disciple, because he\nwas a Galilean, on account of his accent. John however tells us that,\nthe person making the challenge is a relative of the slave who had\nhis ear cut off by Peter earlier, and he is saying that Peter had\nbeen in the garden and therefore had to be a disciple of Jesus. That\nwas very threatening, for this man has a personal reason to hate him.</strong></p><p><strong>Many\npeople reading the account of Peter\u2019s denial conclude that the\nreason why he disowned Jesus at this time was because of fear. We\nthink fear may have been a factor, but not the main factor.  Peter is\nnot portrayed as a fearful man. He was willing to stick his neck out\nwhen other disciples held back. It was Peter who walked on the water\n(maybe foolishly} while the rest watched from the safety of the boat.\nIt was Peter who not only promised to stay with Jesus even unto\ndeath, but also was the first and only one to draw his sword and use\nit. In the Garden, Peter was willing to die for His Master. And think\nof the odds\u2014one man, one sword against an entire crowd, heavily\narmed.  That doesn\u2019t look like fear to me.</strong></p><p><strong>Peter\nfinds himself in the middle of the enemy camp, he is in a situation\nwhere he is out of his depth, and consequently very vulnerable. Here\nhe was having a major paradigm shift. When Peter saw the object of\nhis worship and loyalty, his God and Messiah humbly submitting to\ngross injustice; Peter\u2019s understanding of Messiah\u2019s predicted\npower and His coming kingdom fell apart. Everything Peter lived for,\npower over the Jews and Romans, the prestige of a high office,\nexaltation as a hand picked disciple of Jesus, bravery, valour,\ncourage and victory over the enemies of Jesus \u2013 evaporated right\nbefore his eyes. </strong></p><p><strong>There\nare a number of consequences of denying Jesus that we should mention.</strong></p><p><strong>Denial\nbreeds denial. It is rarely that any denial of Jesus is a one off\nisolated incident; it usually starts off small and like a rolling\nsnowball gets bigger and bigger. Denying Jesus in small things\nusually proceeds to greater denial.  </strong></p><p><strong>Denial\nof Jesus will usually mean we will have to lie about ourselves. Luke\ntells us that when Peter was asked. \u201cYou also are one of them,\u201d\nMan I am not.\u201d Peter replied. Luke 22:58. When any one of us begins\nto live a life that denies Jesus, we will cease to be honest with\nourselves, and begin to deny who we really are.</strong></p><p><strong>Denying\nJesus will bring out the worse in us.  The word that Matthew uses in\n26:74 for curse is katanathematizo.  This is the only time this word\nis used in the bible; it literally means to curse vehemently. At this\ntime Peter was very angry and out of control. Before he met Jesus he\nwas a rough Galilean fisherman and in denying Jesus all his sinful\nhabits began to come to the surface. </strong></p><p><strong>Denying\nJesus will lead to bitter brokenness. Try and see this Galilean\nfisherman standing in the cold on a dark and terrible night, howling\nand weeping in absolute horror. Few of us like to see men crying, but\nPeter could not contain himself, for in the cold of that terrible\nnight, Peter discovered who he really was. The pain of self-discovery\nbecame the catalyst for a life that was to depend on grace. The sobs\nand howls of this broken man would be the means by which he would go\non to live by grace.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsteps to denial are usually small but significant.

    "html": "<p><strong>Remember\nthe first disciples were fishermen, who would have been able to\nrelate to what Jesus is saying here. So when we read \u201cBe Careful,\u201d\nJesus is wanting to get our attention, he is saying that if we do not\nhear what he is going to say here, we are in danger of beaching our\nfaith and shipwrecking our testimonies.  </strong></p><p><strong>One\nof the ways we shipwreck our faith is sometimes we forget who we\nreally are, we forget that we are children of the living God.\nSometimes the storms of life cause us to hit the rocks and we feel\nthat we have been \u2018beached\u2019 or stuck and we can\u2019t move. </strong></p><p><strong>It\nis so easy to react to the storms of life by feeling that I must try\nharder, I must pray more, and I must read the bible more so I can get\nthrough this crisis. Spiritual disciplines are always a good thing.\nHowever in times of crisis we need more than spiritual disciplines\nand self effort, we need a fresh revelation of God. </strong></p><p><strong>Every\ncommentary I have read on Matthew 6 believes that Jesus is teaching\nhis disciples how to practice healthy wholesome Christian\ndisciplines.  So he talks about how they should give to the poor, how\nthey should pray and how they should fast.  Jesus is teaching how to\ncultivate a proper heart attitude so they can participate in the\nnatural spiritual requirements of a follower of Jesus. The more I\nhave looked at the chapter, the more I am inclined to think that the\ngiving, praying and fasting, which are extremely important, are\nsecondary issues as far as Matthew 6 is concerned. There is a much\nmore important issue that is not often picked up.</strong></p><p><strong>If\nyou read the whole Sermon on the Mount especially chapter 6 you will\nfind one word that is repeated 17 times, 11 of which are in chapter\n6. That word is Father. The word father is found more in Matthew 6\nthan any other chapter in the bible therefore it has a lot to teach\nus about God as our father, and what it means to be his child.</strong></p><p><strong>It\u2019s\nreally important to God that we have a revelation of what it means to\nhave Him as our father. How we live and what we live for is\ndetermined by our understanding of the fatherhood of God and the\nsecurity it produces in our lives.</strong></p><p><strong>Before\nwe look at the chapter let us say a few things about God as our\nfather.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nthe Old Testament, the Jewish people had some kind of concept of God\nbeing a loving Father; however, this understanding of God was not\noften used. They saw God more as the Father of the nation, but not\nthe individual. </strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus prayed he used the Aramaic word Abba for father.  This is a\nword that was only used in the context of the home; it carried the\nidea on intimacy and respect. The Jews of Jesus\u2019 time would have\nconversed in Aramaic or used Greek in everyday life, but they were\ntrained to pray in classical Hebrew. It was similar to some Catholics\nwho used to only pray in Latin. </strong></p><p><strong>They\nwould recite words but not necessarily understand what they meant.  </strong></p><p><strong>To\nthis day a Jewish boy coming to Bar mitzvah learns the correct\nresponses off by heart in Hebrew, even if he has no idea what he is\nsaying.  The Jewish people at the time of Christ would have had a\nconcept of God as a loving and protective father. It was not a\ncompletely new or alien concept to them but they rarely addressed God\nas \u201cFather\u201d in prayer, which Jesus almost always did.</strong></p><p><strong>What\nhappens if you were brought up in a family where the father figure\nwas not very good, or may not have even been there?  In Matthews\nGospel fathers are portrayed in a primarily negative light, often\nbeing the ones that must be left behind by the sons who were chosen\nto follow the commands of the kingdom of heaven. For example, in\n4:21\u201322 it is stated twice that the fishermen disciples leave their\nfather in the midst of their joint work to follow Jesus, literally\nleaving their father holding the nets that were not mended. See\n10:21, 34-37. Matthew wants to draw a contrast between failing\nearthly fathers and a perfect heavenly father.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nbiblical times a persons\u2019 identity was always tied up with their\nfather, e.g. when Jesus first met Simon He said, \u2018You are Simon son\nof John you shall be called Peter\u2019. John 1.42. The designation \u2018son\nof\u2019 was like our surnames, it helped distinguish people who had the\nsame first name.</strong></p><p><strong>\"You\nsum up the whole of New Testament teaching in a single phrase, if you\nspeak of it as a revelation of the Fatherhood of the holy Creator. In\nthe same way, you sum up the whole of New Testament religion if you\ndescribe it as the knowledge of God as one's Holy Father. If you want\nto judge how well a person understands Christianity, find out how\nmuch he makes of the thought of being God's child, and having God as\nhis Father. If this is not the thought that prompts and controls his\nworship and prayers and his whole outlook on life, it means that he\ndoes not understand Christianity very well at all.\" Citation: J.\nI. Packer, Knowing God, p. 182.</strong></p><p><strong>What\ncan we learn about God being our Father from this chapter?</strong></p><p><strong>The\nspiritual disciplines we practice must be done in the context of\nenjoying God as father. It is so easy to reduce our relationship with\nGod into a religious box-ticking exercise where reputation becomes\nmore important than intimacy. These people became religious, doing\nthe right things in the wrong way, and gradually they became trapped\nin a need to get their affirmation and approval from others because\nthey had not grasped the fact that God is their father. When people\nloose their way spiritually it is not because they are bad people,\nbut their waywardness can be traced back to the fact that they have\nceased to believe that God is a loving father.  </strong></p><p><strong>As\nGod is our Father then we need to be real and honest before him. When\nwe are told that </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>we\nshould do our acts of righteousness in secret,</strong></span><strong>\nit would be very easy to put a literal translation on this and think\nyou should only pray in a private place, but that misses the point. </strong></p><p><strong><br/>\nSomeone\ncould do something in secret and still have a heart of a hypocrite.\nThe secret refers to an attitude that is the antithesis to that of\nthe hypocrite. Sometimes we act before God in the same way the\nhypocrites comes before men. They acted in a certain way to get the\napproval and praise of men. They acted out of unreality in order to\nimpress others; they were not being real or honest. </strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes\nthat is how we come before God, we think we need to impress him, we\nneed to win his approval, we are not honest about ourselves, and we\nhave the same heart attitudes as the hypocrite who engages in a\npublic performance. Our father is looking for authenticity not\nperformance.</strong></p><p><strong>I\nshould also mention that we all have an inspired need from time to\ntime to shut the door to the world and everything else and be alone\nwith God because we love him and long to give ourselves to him. </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that no matter the circumstances I am facing you are always\na loving father.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Luke 4:1-6:26</p>",

The word that is used for the reward that the hypocrite receives from other people, and the word for reward that is used to describe the father\u2019s response to authentic spirituality are different.

Not once does Jesus\nrefer to money.  All the giving is of a practical kind. Can I suggest\ntwo reasons for that?</strong></p><p><strong>No\nmatter how little or how much we have materially we are all\nresponsible to reach out to others in need. The issue is not how much\nor how little we have, but the condition of our hearts.</strong></p><p><strong>We\ncan only touch the heart of Jesus as we give ourselves to those in\nneed. Reading the passage you sense that those who were authentic\nbelievers gave more than the person needed, in the process of meeting\nthe needs of others, they gave themselves also.</strong></p><p><strong>As\nChristians we should be sacrificially investing ourselves in the\nlives of needy and broken people; to do so is to prove that our love\nfor Jesus is authentic. It may be that our refusal to give ourselves\nto others has a dehumanising effect on us. We cease to be the people\nGod intended us to be.   Not to care for those in need is to deface\nthe Image of God in ourselves, for God is a caring God.</strong></p><p><strong>Any\nindifference to the plight of the needy suggests that we almost\napprove of any suffering they may be going through.  Furthermore\nthrough our indifference we are adding to their suffering.  </strong></p><p><strong>For\nevil to advance, all is needed is for good men to do nothing. </strong></p><p><strong>What\nwas the motive behind these people doing these deeds?</strong></p><p><strong>If\nwe read the parable carefully you will notice that the righteous on\nJesus\u2019 right-hand side were surprised when they were commended for\ntheir good deeds. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u2018Lord when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give\nyou something to drink?  </strong></span></p><p><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>When\ndid we see you a stranger and invite you in, and needing clothes we\nclothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go and visit\nyou?\u2019  </strong></span></p><p><strong>They\nwere completely shocked by what Jesus had said. </strong></p><p><strong>Their\nshock indicates a number of things.</strong></p><p><strong>(a)\nThey responded to the needs of others with no hidden agenda; they\nwere not secretly hoping that their good deeds would buy them some\nbrownie points! </strong></p><p><strong>(b)\nResponding to the needs of others is a natural and spontaneous\nexpression of a righteous character.  In Hebrew there is no word for\ncharity.  Rather the caring for those in need is called Tzedaka, a\nderivative of the Hebrew term for righteousness.  So, evidence of\ntrue righteousness is caring for others not because you feel obliged,\nbut because you are expressing authentic righteousness, it should be\na default reaction.</strong></p><p><strong>Why\nwould righteous living motivate someone to reach out to needy people?\n </strong></p><p><strong>Righteousness\nis very fulfilling and satisfying, creating within a person a deep\nsense of security so when a person is feeling secure they have the\nemotional confidence and the motivational impetus to reach out and\ncare for others.</strong></p><p><strong>Remember\nJesus said </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018Blessed\nare they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be\nfilled.\u2019 </strong></span></p><p><strong>The\ncondemnation of the goats on the left.</strong><u><strong>\n</strong></u></p><p><strong>The\nruling religious leaders of Jesus\u2019 day formed a counsel, known as\nthe Sanhedrin.  During civil court cases, the Sanhedrin had a very\ndefinite way of identifying who was guilty and who was innocent.  If\nyou were acquitted of the crimes of which you were accused, you would\nbe set on the right hand side of the judge.  If you were condemned,\nyou would be set on his left hand side.  Thus, anyone looking on\ncould immediately tell whether you had been found guilty or innocent.\n The left hand (in the Arab world) is the unclean hand.  You would\nnever offer it to someone, nor would you even be allowed to strike\nsomeone with it. </strong></p><p><strong>The\ngoats of this parable didn\u2019t see the needs around them, let alone\nrecognise the presence of God in the suffering of the world.  They\nwere oblivious, and when called to account by the God of the universe\nthey can only say, \u2018We didn't know any of this mattered to you.  We\ndidn't know you were involved; we certainly didn't see you there.\u2019\t</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Let\nus remember that these are people who honestly think they are sheep! \nThey can point with pride to a moment when they made a profession of\nbelief, they are, perhaps dogmatic about a creed and are church\nmembers in good standing.

    "html": "<p><strong>It\nis important that we understand why Jesus may have done this. The\nSigns that Jesus refers to are describing what God will be doing\nbefore the return of Jesus. The parables, however, tell us what we\nshould be doing, or how we should be living with his return in mind. \nTherefore, can we suggest that is probably more important that we\nunderstand and grasp the message behind the parables, and worry less\nabout the signs, which we have no control over? </strong></p><p><strong>Before\nwe look at the parable of the ten virgins we need to say a word about\nhow we should read these parables. Parables are stories Jesus used to\nmake a spiritual point. However, some people have fallen into the\ntrap of how they interpret the parable; they believe that everything\nin the story has a secondary meaning. So these people think that the\nfive foolish bridesmaids, the five wise bridesmaids, the lamps, the\noil and the bridegroom are all allegories of something else. This\nkind of interpretation can cause confusion, robbing us of the truth\nthat Jesus wants to communicate.  </strong></p><p><strong>The\nBackground of the Parable</strong></p><p><strong>A\nwedding was the greatest event in a village or a town. It was the\ngreatest single social celebration; where everybody got involved,\nfriends, family, extended family, everyone. It was a time of great\nhappiness; it was a time of festivity and celebration. And that's the\nscene we have here.</strong></p><p><strong>But\nit's essential for us to know that in a Jewish marriage, there were\nthree elements. The first is engagement. Long before the scene we\nhave here, there was an engagement. This was an official contract\nbetween the two fathers who were giving their daughter and their son\nto each other, as it were. So engagements weren't really made with\nthe couple, they were made between the fathers.</strong></p><p><strong>A\nlittle while after that, there would be what was called the second\nphase of the wedding or the marriage which was the betrothal. Now the\nbetrothal was the official ceremony. The couple would come together\nbefore friends and family and they would make vows and covenants and\nbinding promises. They had an actual marriage ceremony and they made\ntheir commitments. Then letter they were then officially married. \nAny breaking of a betrothal period was only through a divorce. There\nhad to be an actual divorce to dissolve the betrothal, this divorce\nwas binding.  Also if the husband happened to die during that period,\nthe wife was considered a widow even though the marriage had not been\nphysically consummated nor were they living together.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nthird phase was the wedding feast, the wedding celebration itself\nwhere the groom would go to the bride\u2019s house where she would be\nwaiting with all of her bridesmaids. He arrives with all of the men\nthat are with him and he collects his bride and her maids and they\nall go with torches, parading in the night through the village in a\ncelebration of singing and joy that is unequalled in their social\nlife. The day has finally come, everything is ready.  He has prepared\na home for her and is now going to get her and take her to that\nplace. When they arrive at his home that night, the wedding party\nwould go into the house and celebrate for as long as seven days. \nThis starts at night time because they want to be able to go through\nthe village with their lanterns so everyone would see them and enjoy\nthe festival atmosphere.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you we can joyfully look forward to the return of Jesus.   </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Luke 14:12-16:31</p>",

      "One of the things that cause much debate and confusion among Christians is the Second coming of Christ. People form theological allegiances with others based on what they believe about Jesus\u2019 return. Churches have split because there was no commonality when it came to what people believed about Jesus\u2019 second coming. The return of Jesus has for many become a divisive and contentious topic, but this was never meant to be.",
      "In the book of Matthew we have five different sections of teaching given by Jesus. The last section of teaching that Matthew records for us is what is known as the Olivet Discourse. This is an extended teaching given by Christ about his second coming and the end of the world. This discourse is recorded in Matthew chapters 24 and 25. If you were to take the time to read through this discourse you would notice that in a general way Jesus uses two distinct methods to communicate the truth he wants to get over. In the first half of the discourse Jesus talks about signs Matthew 24:4-35. In the second half Jesus talks in Parables."

    "html": "<p><strong>As\nwe have already said, it would be very easy for us to get bogged down\nin types and allegories and miss the message of the parable. So to\nhelp us learn something from the parable let us ask this question. \nThe five foolish bridesmaids brought no oil.  What does that say\nabout them and what was going on in their hearts and minds?</strong></p><p><strong>The\nfact that the five foolish bridesmaids had no oil was an expression\nof their mindset, of their world view; it was a consequence of how\nthey had always looked at life and the world around them.  Coming to\nthe feast without oil was an ongoing natural expression of how they\nhad always lived. So in this parable Jesus is warning us, if you\nthink like these foolish bridesmaids you may share their fate. If we\nhave the same mindset as them then we will not be ready for Jesus\u2019\nreturn as they were not ready for the bridegroom. So what has this to\nteach us?</strong></p><p><strong>They\nrefused to engage their minds and think things through. When Jesus\nrefers to the five wise bridesmaids he does not use the usual word\nfor wisdom which is Sophia, rather he uses the word \u2018phronimos\ncould be better translated as \"thoughtful\" or \"considerate\"\n(in the sense of someone who tries to consider all the facts in order\nto make a wise judgment.) Often in Christian circles we are\ndiscouraged from using our minds. We seldom take the time to sit down\nand think through what we believe, why we believe it and what the\nconsequences of our beliefs are. We come to church, we sit in our\npews and often we are disengaged from what is being said. Jesus would\nhave never taught the way we teach today. In Jesus\u2019 day, during the\nteaching, there was always some kind of interaction, between him and\nthose he was teaching. A lot of our lethargy is rooted in our\nthinking. Our English word for lethargic come from the Greek word\n</strong><em><strong>lethargos\nwhich means forgetfulness. </strong></em><strong>\nSo it is very important that we use our minds that we ask questions,\nthat we wrestle with scriptures, and work hard to get a better\nunderstanding of what they are saying.</strong></p><p><strong>They\nwere half hearted in how they lived. How do we know that? Well the\ntext tells us that they brought their lamps but no oil; think about\nthat, it doesn\u2019t make sense; it\u2019s like us buying a lamp and not\nbuying a bulb to put in it.  They approached their role as\nbridesmaids with a half hearted attitude.</strong></p><p><strong>Being\nhalf hearted about our relationship with Jesus will prevent us from\nfinishing the race, we will give up. The nature of Christianity is\nsuch that it requires us to be passionate about it. A Christian\nwithout passion is like paint without colour, or music without sound.\nIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.  </strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Our\nLord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak. We are\nhalf-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and\nambition, when infinite joy is offered to us, like an ignorant child\nwho wants to go on making mud pies in the slum because he cannot\nimagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are\nfar too easily pleased.\u2019 C.S.Lewis </strong><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1629232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The\nWeight of Glory, and Other Addresses</strong></a></p><p><strong>For\nthese Foolish Bridesmaids looking right was more important than being\nright. As you read this story you will notice that there was no\nmention of any external differences between the wise and foolish\nbridesmaids. They all looked as if they were honestly fulfilling\ntheir role, until the lack of oil of the foolish bridesmaids is\nmentioned. They looked the part to the onlooker, but in reality\nreputation was more important than authenticity.  The life of a child\nof God in the kingdom should be one of authenticity, we should never\nappear to be one thing and in reality be something completely\ndifferent.  </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nam I a Christian without passion like paint without colour.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Luke 17:1-19:27</p>",

      "We need to realise that suffering and glory are often the same thing. In our world view we often compartmentalise life, we have everything boxed up in neat compartments, especially when it comes to suffering and glory. Luke tells us that Moses and Elijah were speaking to Jesus about his death Luke 9:30. They were not talking about his victory, or his splendour, or his majesty, but his death. There are a number of verses in John 13 that clearly show the relationship between glory and suffering."

Though we are no longer under Old Testament civil law,\nit is not difficult to understand why adultery could lead to such\nserious judgment. especially when compared to the other ancient Near\nEastern law codes. The Mosaic law was very tough on crimes against\npeople, relationships, and the family unit. The other law codes were\nvery tough on property crimes \u2013 for example, cutting off hands for\nstealing. This difference highlights the contrasting value-systems of\nthe people of God and those around them \u2013 of prioritising people\nversus things. </strong></p><p><strong>In\nsome cases, according to the Jewish law book, the Mishnah, the\nadulterer is to be executed by strangulation. Even the shocking\nmethod of strangulation is set down in the Mishnah which is a very\nprecise book and not to be read by the faint hearted\u2026 </strong></p><p><strong>The\nadulterer is to be placed in a manure pile up to his or her knees. A\nsoft towel set within a rough towel is placed around the neck. The\ntowels are drawn tighter and tighter until death occurs.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nreligious leaders hoped to impale Jesus on the horns of a dilemma. If\nhe agreed with the Old Testament law and called for her execution,\nthey could accuse him of sedition before the Romans, because since 30\nAD the Romans had taken away the Jews' right of capital punishment.\nHowever, if he said she shouldn't be stoned, they could accuse him of\nfalse teaching and discredit him with the people.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nOld Testament law mandated that to be prosecuted, adulterers needed\nto be caught in the act (Num. 5:13). Rabbi Samuel said, \"In the\ncase of adulterers, they (the witnesses) must have seen them in the\nposture of adulterers.\"Another scholar of Talmudic law says,\n\"(It is not just an issue) of their having seen the couple in a\n`compromising situation,' for example, coming from a room in which\nthey were alone, or even lying together on the same bed. The actual\nphysical movements of the couple must have been capable of no other\nexplanation, and the witnesses must have seen exactly the same acts\nat exactly the same time, in the presence of each other, so that\ntheir depositions would be identical in every respect.\"</strong></p><p><strong>As\nwe read the account of this story in John, we see that the religious\nleaders tell Jesus that the woman had indeed been caught \u2018in the\nvery act of adultery\u2019. It seems that they have been</strong><strong>\nconscientious </strong><strong>in\ntheir compliance with the detail of the Torah. However, their\nadherence to the law was selective and flawed.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nTorah also stated that both parties were to be produced and\nprosecuted (Deut. 22:22). If they caught the woman \u2018in the very\nact,\u2019 then where is the man? It is obvious that there is a\nconspiracy here! The whole story could have been fabricated, but the\nmost plausible explanation is that these men have set the woman up to\nuse her in their attempt to discredit Jesus. </strong></p><p><strong>They\nmay have sent an \u2018undercover agent\u2019 to solicit the woman\u2019s\nservices (maybe even one of their own number), then on a pre-arranged\nsignal, they burst in, let </strong><em><strong>him</strong></em><strong>\ngo and dragged </strong><em><strong>her</strong></em><strong>\nto Jesus.

They\nare feeling ignored and we read that they </strong><strong>\u2018demanded\nan answer\u2019.</strong><strong>\nBut Jesus slows everything down. He dictates the pace. He takes the\nsituation out of the hands of the Pharisees and takes it into his own\nhands. Try and imagine the tension at this point. The Pharisees feel\nthey have caught Jesus in a trap, and they are longing for him to\nincriminate himself, but he says nothing. Sometimes in tense\nsituations we can say more without the use of words.</strong></p><p><strong>There\nhas been much debate about what Jesus may have written, but John\ndoesn\u2019t tell us, so it mustn\u2019t be important for us to know.\nHowever, Jesus writing on the ground must have taken the focus away\nfrom the woman. </strong></p><p><strong>When\nJesus finally stands and speaks, he says </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018If\nany of you are without sin let him be the first to throw a stone at\nher.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>Notice\nJesus doesn\u2019t speak about the woman, but rather about the heart\nattitude of the self-righteous Pharisees.

It may be that the older\nones realized that their trap for Jesus didn\u2019t work, and according\nto Roman law they had no powers of execution. Or perhaps they had\nmore sin in their hearts.

Go and sin no more.\"</strong></span><strong>\nFirst God assures us of his forgiveness; then he calls on us to\ncooperate with him as he liberates us from a life of sin. Why is this\norder so important? Because of the way God motivates us to live for\nhim. RELIGION SAYS: \"Change, or I will condemn you.\" The\nfear and threat of God's condemnation is always potentially hanging\nover our heads in order to \"keep us in line.\"This does not\npromote deep and lasting change. People who live under by this\nprinciple tend to have a superficial and self-righteous kind of\nholiness. By contrast, GRACE SAYS: \"I have forgiven and accepted\nyou. Now respond to my love by allowing me to change your life.\nLoving gratitude is the most powerful motivator in the universe. We\ndon't change in order to be accepted, but because we have been\naccepted. Real righteousness is practising love toward God and\nothers. Nothing motivates this kind of lifestyle like forgiveness\nreceived.

Is he just like an\nindulgent parent who lets things go unchecked and doesn\u2019t deal with\nthe heart of the matter? </strong></p><p><strong>Maybe\nthis is one of the reasons why we struggle so much with grace, it\nseems to undermine justice and fairness. To think that God loves the\nperson who has caused you so much pain and distress, just as much as\nhe loves you, can be a frightening and unsettling thought. Grace\nunderstands and accepts that no matter how guilty a person may be,\ntheir misdeeds, or mistreatment of us cannot reduce their value as\npeople who are still loved by God, and people whom God wants us to\nlove too, and that is very difficult. </strong></p><p><strong>You\ncould say that this story of the lady caught in adultery contains one\nof the greatest \u2018miracles\u2019 of Jesus\u2019 ministry.

When people feel\nthreatened, or are not prepared to face their own problems, they can\nbegin to question and belittle the identity of others. The people of\nJerusalem were unable to accept what Jesus had been saying so they\nbecame hostile by being superficial about his identity. Their\nsuperficiality and hostility towards Jesus was rooted in the fact\nthat they didn\u2019t really know him:</strong></p><p><strong>They\ntalked </strong><em><strong>about</strong></em><strong>\nhim, not </strong><em><strong>to</strong></em><strong>\nhim. \u2018Isn\u2019t this the man they are trying to kill?\u2019 John 7:25.\nThese remarks are neither a confession about Jesus' identity nor a\ntestimony on his behalf. Rather they voice a question to each other. </strong></p><p><strong>Furthermore\nthey stopped listening to what Jesus was saying. Remember, Jesus was\nstill teaching at this point, and as he was speaking, they began to\ntalk to each other. Their actions indicated that they didn\u2019t think\nJesus was worth listening to. They didn\u2019t like what they were\nhearing so they switched off (like we often do), and turned their\nattention elsewhere. </strong></p><p><strong>John\nsays 7:26 \u2018At that point some of the people in Jerusalem began to\nask..\u2019 What \u2018point\u2019 is John referring to?

It seems as though they didn\u2019t like the implications of\nwhat Jesus was saying. So, as a sign of their disapproval they\nstopped listening, refusing to give Jesus their full attention, They\nbegan to discuss him, knowing that he was able to hear what they were\nsaying. This is a classic example of superficiality, and disdain for\na person. This was an expression of rude disregard that belittled\nJesus and his teaching. </strong></p><p><strong>They\nrefused to take any responsibility in wanting Jesus dead.

The people of Jerusalem were not prepared to\nhelp Jesus, or stand up for him, even though they are aware of the\nplots against him. They are for complicit in these murderous threats.\nTheir lack of concern for Jesus made them as guilty as the religious\nleaders. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe negation of our responsibilities towards\nothers will encourage superficiality.

There\u2019s always someone\nelse to \u2018carry the can\u2019, but it\u2019s never us. Our superficiality\nprevents us from taking a good honest look at our own hearts, so we\nwill automatically look for someone else to pin the blame on.\nRemember this was this same Jerusalem crowd that would eventually\ndemand the blood and death of Jesus  </strong></p><p><strong>They\nallowed others to influence their opinions about Jesus, refusing to\ncome to their own conclusions. As the people discuss the rumoured\nplans to kill Jesus, they wonder whether the leaders had changed\ntheir mind, for John tells us that Jesus is \u2018speaking publicly and\nthey are not saying a word to him\u2019 John 7:26a. So the people ask\n\u2018Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Christ\u2019\njohn 7:26b. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt appears that these people are not\nprepared to decide for themselves who Jesus was, but they prefer to\nbe influenced by what their leaders </strong><em><strong>might</strong></em><strong>\nhave been thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a warning here for all who\ncall themselves disciples of Jesus. We live at a time where\nChristians are not encouraged to think critically about their faith\nor consider why they believe what they believe. It\u2019s too easy for\nus to sit in church, expecting to be spoon-fed, and then simply\nregurgitate what we\u2019ve been told. We settle for second-hand faith,\nrather than first-hand experience of Jesus. And this is always fatal.\nAfter all, faith without relationship is little more than dry\northodoxy. It hardens the soul and kills the spirit within.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe\nneed to be taught to think for ourselves and come to our own\nconclusions about Jesus and his truth.

Even\nif their opinions weren\u2019t based on popular myth, they were probably\nunable to reconcile Jesus\u2019 ordinariness with their expectations of\nthe Promised Messiah</strong></p><p><strong>The\nproblem was that they forgot what the Scriptures said:</strong></p><p><strong>\"But\nyou, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands\nof Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler\nin Israel, Whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting\"\n(Micah 5:2 NKJV).  </strong></p><p><strong>God\u2019s\npromised Messiah is fulfilled in the person of Jesus, from Nazareth.</strong></p><p><strong>A\nrigorous application of the word of God to our lives will prevent us\nfrom living superficially and developing superficial relationships.\nIf we don\u2019t take our bibles seriously, then we won\u2019t take Jesus\nseriously.

Bible knowledge is incomplete if it doesn\u2019t lead\nto a strong desire for God and a deeper knowledge of God. </strong></p><p><strong>Many\npeople read their bibles in the same way they would read an\nencyclopaedia:  they amass information and facts. The bible is more\nlike a personal journal than an encyclopaedia \u2013 God\u2019s personal\njournal, where the Father shares his life and heart. The people\nstanding around Jesus as he taught in the temple refused to take\ntheir Old Testament seriously, and choose to believe an urban myth,\nwhich had no scriptural authority.           </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nresponse to superficiality</strong></p><p><strong>Superficial\nrelationships with Jesus and with others are often acceptable to us.\nWe have an unhealthy tolerance towards \u2018shallow living,\u2019 which\nexpects little from our relationships. The great thing about this\npassage in John, is that it shows us that Jesus will never tolerate a\nsuperficial relationship with those he loves. He didn\u2019t tolerate it\nthen. He won\u2019t tolerate it now. We matter too much to him.</strong></p><p><strong>How\ndid Jesus respond to the superficiality of the people?<br/>\n</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Jesus\ncried out. \u2018Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts cried\nout.\u2019 Including this occasion, the Gospel record says that on four\noccasions Jesus raised his voice to make a point. (John 12:44,\nMatthew 27:50; Mark 15:37; John 7:37). The Greek word for \u2018cried\nout\u2019 is </strong><em><strong>krazo</strong></em><strong>.\nOriginally, this word described the unpleasant sound of a raven. It\nthen came to refer to any screeching or screaming or crying out. The\nimplication being that the sounds were not pleasant to hear. It is\nthe fearful sound that the disciples in the boat make when they\nthought they were seeing a ghost walking on the water (14:26). It is\nthe tone of voice that Peter uses when he begins to sink: \"Lord,\nsave me.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>This\nwas a cry of pain and frustration. The people of Jerusalem had just\nused a legend or familiar folklore to completely dismiss Jesus and\nall that he stood for. Jesus felt the pain of misunderstanding, so he\ncried out, just as he did on the cross. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nchallenges their supposed knowledge of him. They had claimed to know\nJesus, and where he was from, so as he continues to teach, we read\nthat Jesus \u2018cried out\u2019:</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u2018Yes you know me and know where I am from.\u2019 </strong></span><strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThe\nphrase can be punctuated as a statement or as a question. Personally,\nI think he asked a question with irony: \"So you know me and know\nwhere I am from? You think?\u201d It was a confrontation of the people's\narrogance. This seems like the best interpretation because\nimmediately Jesus pointed out their ignorance John 7:28b-29.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we need to challenge assumptions, expose\nignorance, and confront misunderstandings. Jesus wanted them to know,\nthat their understanding of him was so inadequate and incomplete that\nhe could say, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018they\ndon\u2019t know me at all.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nJohn 7:28 I find this statement very challenging. I wonder how Jesus\nwould describe my knowledge of him. <br/>\n</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Jesus\ngoes on to tells them where he came from. They suspected that he came\nfrom Galilee or Bethlehem, but they were wrong, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018I\nam not here on my own, but he who sent me is true. You do not know\nhim, but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.\u2019</strong></span><strong>\nJesus found his identity and his security in his fellowship with his\nfather, not in the opinions and reactions of men.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuperficiality\nis a disease that robs our hearts of whole life, and the only\nsafeguard against superficial living and superficial relationships is\nto really know God. We realise that Jesus knew the Father in a way no\none else could, but if we look at what Jesus says here, we discover\nsomething of what it means to know God.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing God means\nthat you have a sense of being sent by God. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cBut\nI know him because I am from him and he sent me.</strong></span><strong>\nJesus had a strong sense of purpose and direction. He didn\u2019t wonder\naimlessly through life, but he knew that he was sent by God. Knowing\nGod gives a person purpose and direction.   </strong></p><p><strong>The\nword John uses for \u2018send\u2019 in verse 29 is the Greek word\n</strong><em><strong>apastello,\n</strong></em><strong>which\nmeans \u2018I send\u2019. The word had the same meaning in both the Jewish\nand Greek worlds. It's used in Greek Classical Literature of the\ncommissioning of a ship. The Jews used this term of men sent out by\nrabbis to teach in their name and with their authority. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot\nknowing God will rob a person of their God given \u2018apostolic\nnature\u2019. I\u2019m not suggesting that we are all going to be apostles\n\u2013 the Apostles were special individuals who God used at the genesis\nof the church. However, I do mean that as children of God, we each\nhave a built-in necessity to respond to the commission of God and\nbecome \u2018a sent one\u2019, an apostle, bringing his message to the\nworld. Knowing God will motivate us to respond to the God who loves\nto send people out.    </strong></p><p><strong>Knowing\nGod means that we will come </strong><em><strong>from</strong></em><strong>\nGod. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>But\nI know him because I am </strong></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><em><strong>from</strong></em></span><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\nhim.</strong></span><strong>\nIn a very special way, Jesus came from the Father; he was with his\nFather before the world was created. However, in a different sense we\nneed to be continually \u2018coming from the Father\u2019. Knowing God is\nrooted in intimacy and fellowship with God and intimacy with God is\nthe only authentic source for life and ministry. It would be\nwonderful if people could look at our lives and conclude that we have\nbeen \u2018sent from God!\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>Are\nwe like the whale, frantically trying to live life in the shallow?\nAre our relationships verging on the meaninglessness because they\nlack vulnerability, honesty and depth?</strong></p><p><strong>Or\ndo we </strong><em><strong>really</strong></em><strong>\nwant to know God and experience intimacy with Him so that we can\ncultivate relationships that are deep, enriching and free from the\nblight of superficiality.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay I never cause Jesus to feel the pain of superficiality.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Acts 7:30-9:22</p>",

There were wells at Sheria, and had they been unable to take the place by nightfall, thousands were doomed to die of thirst. \u201cWe fought that day,\u201d writes Gilbert, \u201cas men fight for their lives... We entered Sheria station on the heels of the retreating Turks. The first objects which met our view were the great stone cisterns full of cold, clear, drinking water. In the still night air the sound of water running into the tanks could be distinctly heard, maddening in its nearness; yet not a man murmured when orders were given for the battalions to fall in, two deep, facing the cisterns\u201d He then describes the stern priorities: the wounded, those on guard duty, then company by company. It took four hours before the last man had his drink of water, and in all that time they had been standing twenty feet from a low stone wall on the other side of which were thousands of gallons of water.

The researchers left one\nset in the water and found that within an hour they had all drowned.\nThe other rats were periodically lifted out of the water and then\nreturned. When that happened, the second set of rats swam for over 24\nhours. Why? Not because they were given a rest, but because they\nsuddenly had hope! Those animals somehow hoped that if they could\nstay afloat just a little longer, someone would reach down and rescue\nthem.

They saw this as a way for Jesus to continue His ministry without the threat of the Jewish leaders who lived in Jerusalem.",
      "This incident gives us some insight into misunderstanding and how it works. These people did a number of things that compounded their misunderstanding. (1) They assumed that they understood what Jesus meant when he said \"I am going to be with you just a little while longer and then I will go away to him who sent me. You will seek for me but you will not find me, and where I am you cannot come\" (2) They didn\u2019t listen properly to what Jesus said. When they quoted Jesus they said \u2018what does he mean when he said, you will look for me, but you will not find me, and where I am you cannot come.\u2019 They left out \"I am going to be with you just a little while longer and then I will go away to him who sent me.\u201d If they had listened to all that Jesus said, and thought about it they would have been unable to come to the conclusions they did, because Jesus said, \u2018then I will go away to him who sent me.\u2019 Not to the Jews in the diaspora. Listening to others means that we choose to hear all they have got to say, and not jump to our own conclusions. (3) John says, \u2018The Jews said to one another.\u2019 They didn\u2019t bring their questions to Jesus, but discussed amongst themselves. When people begin to discuss misunderstandings instead of going to the right source where they can be addressed, then people become more inclined to believe fiction over fact. At this juncture Jesus did not correct their misunderstanding,"

Flowing\nwater is usually drinkable water </strong></p><p><strong>something\nvery important </strong></p><p><strong>The\npeople who were opposing Jesus in this context represented those in\nneed of living water, people who were unable to manage their thirst.\nThe things that came out of their hearts like hatred and murder\nindicated that they that they were full of \u2018dead water\u2019 and in\nneed of new life, of living water.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>The\nquality of our lives depends upon the work of the Holy Spirit in us.\nJohn informs us \u2018By this he meant the Spirit whom those who believe\nin him would later receive.\u2019 (v39). The way Jesus describes the\nwork of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer is wonderful. We\nare all in need of the ongoing refreshing work of the Spirit in or\nlives. The work of the Spirit within us is to continually refresh us\nso we can endure the pressures of life in a sinful world. We tend to\nthink of the Holy Spirit as a doctrine to be studied, but for the\nfirst believers, the Spirit was understood as someone who empowered\nand refreshed their lives.</strong></p><p><strong>Our\nability to receive and be matured by the Holy Spirit depends on what\nkind of relationship we have with Jesus. As we open up our lives to\nthe Lord Jesus, we are more able to receive and experience the\nministry of the Holy Spirit. We need to relate to Jesus as thirsty\npeople. It is people who </strong><strong>recognise\ntheir thirst for real life that are most able to relate to Jesus. </strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>The\nmain focus of the work of the Spirit in our lives is internally,\ndealing with our characters and emotions. What flows out of our lives\nis a reflection of the content of our hearts. Real and lasting change\ncannot take place in our hearts unless the river from within becomes\nthe thing that distinguishes us. When our hearts are full off\nemotions and attitudes that are contrary to the fruit of the Spirit,\nthen we cannot experience the satisfaction we long for. </strong></p><p><strong>There\nis a sense that what we have received from God is not meant to stay\nwithin us, but is to flow out of us. \"Water\" that stays\nstill becomes stagnant. Could the same thing happen to our faith if\nit is not shared with others?</strong></p><p><strong>Verse\n39 says \u2018Up to this time the spirit had not been given, since Jesus\nhad not been glorified.\u2019 The oldest and best manuscripts do not\ncontain the word \"given.\" They literally say, \"The\n[Holy] Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not been glorified\"\nNRSV: reads \"For as yet there was no Spirit, because Jesus was\nnot yet glorified\". For  John the meaning of Jesus being\nglorified is the crucifixion. John does not mean that the Holy Spirit\ndid not exist until the Cross. After all John's gospel speaks in\nchapter 1 of the Holy Spirit descending and remaining on Jesus. What\nhe means is that the Holy Spirit fully experienced by people and\nrealised in their lives until after the crucifixion. It can be summed\nup by saying that Pentecost was not really possible until the events\nof Calvary had taken place. Thirsty people need to come to the cross\n\u2013 the thirst we all carry can only be quench by a meaningful\nencounter with God and his love for us through the death of his Son. \n</strong></p><p><strong>More\nconfusion about Jesus\u2019 identity.</strong></p><p><strong>Although\nthe crowds heard Jesus speak with the same hope, boldness and love as\nthe temple guards, it did not diminish any confusion they had. The\nJews expected a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit when the Messiah\ncame. They were keenly aware that the Holy Spirit had been the source\nof prophecy in the Old Testament and no prophets had arisen since\nMalachi about 400 B.C. They yearned for a fresh outpouring of the\nSpirit that would be demonstrated by the renewal of prophecy. When\nJesus proclaimed the Spirit as living water coming again in abundance\nfrom himself, one logical conclusion would be that Jesus was\ndeclaring himself to be the Messiah.</strong></p><p><strong>On\nthe other hand some in the crowd could not accept that Jesus was the\nMessiah because they assumed he was from Galilee, not from Bethlehem.\nThis was the second time they used this argument during the week of\nthe feast. They held onto old conclusions, refusing to make enquires\nor learn new things. </strong></p><p><strong>Speaking\nclearly and with authority does not guarantee that all people will\nhear and accept what we have to say. Doing things right, and with\nright motives will not ensure success, but it will mean that we can\nstand before God with a clear conscience. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nresponse of the Jewish leaders</strong></p><p><strong>The\ntemple guards return empty-handed not because they had been rendered\npowerless by Jesus (compare with their later experience in John\n18:3-6), nor because they feared the crowds, for some among the\ncrowds also wanted to seize him (contrast later, Mt 26:5 par. Mk 14:2\npar. Lk 22:2, 6). Rather, they are struck by the uniqueness of Jesus'\nmessage (7:46). This probably accounts for the fact that they were\ngone for four days (cf. 7:14, 32, 37) instead of an hour or so, as\nthe authorities might have expected! It is right that they should be\nstruck by Jesus' teaching. Here, the eternal Word was speaking about\nhimself, about God and about the salvation he had brought in\nfulfilment of the promises made through the prophets. Jesus' very way\nof speaking was unique, as befit his unique messa</strong><strong>ge:\nI.V.P</strong></p><p><strong>Notice\nhow the leaders react to the returning guards. They don\u2019t ask the\nguards what makes Jesus so compelling. Nor do they debate the merits\nof his claims and they certainly don\u2019t suggest that they would like\nto hear him for themselves. Instead they do a number of things:</strong></p><p><strong>A\n    They ridicule the guards (v.47) </strong><em><strong>\"You\nmean He has deceived you too?\"</strong></em><strong>\nThe message is clear, they were asking how the guards could be so\nstupid and gullible. It's a common form of argument, attack your\nopponent, then perhaps you won't have to deal with the issue.  </strong></p><p><strong>B\nThey try to coerce through peer pressure. (v. 48) </strong><em><strong>\"Have\nany of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in Him?\"</strong></em><strong>\nThe message again is clear. If the leaders don't believe in Jesus,\nthen anyone who has any sense won't believe in him either. </strong></p><p><strong>C.\nThey belittle and judge the opposition. (v. 49) </strong><em><strong>\"No,\nbut this mob that knows nothing of the law, there is a curse on\nthem.\"</strong></em><strong>\nHere they insult all who believe in Jesus, referring to them as a\ngang, an unruly mob, the radicals of their day. The implication is\nclear - \"If you don't want to be known as a rebel\u2026renounce\nHim.\"</strong></p><p><strong>D.\nThey would not listen to wise advice. We read that \u2018Nicodemus who\nhad gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their number asked,\n\u201cDoes our law condemn anyone without hearing him to find out the\nfacts?\u201d\u2019 John 7:50and yet they rejected what he had to say.</strong></p><p><strong>E.\nThey told outright lies. When they responded to Nicodemus by saying\nthat a prophet does not come out of Galilee John 7:52, that was not\ntrue, for many believed Jonah was from there.</strong></p><p><strong>Often\nwe are like these religious leaders, we have come to some\nconclusions, and we are determined to avoid facts and truth at all\ncosts, so we do mental gymnastics, twist words, ignore realities, in\nour desperation to avoid Jesus, and in doing so we remain in our\nthirst, expressing it in perverted and harmful ways. </strong></p><p><strong>As\nwe consider the courage of Jesus in this passage and hear his\ngracious invitation to all who are thirsty, let us not make the same\nmistakes as the Pharisees. Let the thirst for life drive us to him,\nwho is the only true source of living water and life everlasting.</strong></p><p><em><strong>Father\nmay living water flow  from my life. </strong></em></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Acts 16:11-18:28</p>",

Nowhere is this more evident than in\nchapter 7 of John\u2019s account of Jesus life.</strong></p><p><strong>As\nwe have already seen, Jesus is conscious of the fact that he is\nhated: </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><em><strong>\u201cThe\nworld cannot hate you, but it hates me because because I testify that\nwhat it does is evil.\u201d</strong></em></span><em><strong>\nJohn 7:7.</strong></em><strong>\nSo, he is fully aware of what lies in wait for him in Jerusalem.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nquestion for us is how best to respond when someone has a hostile\nattitude towards us or if someone is aggressive and angry with us for\nno good reason? As we tag along with Jesus and join him in Jerusalem,\nwe may discover some appropriate ways to manage hostile situations.</strong></p><p><strong>S</strong><strong>etting\nthe scene</strong></p><p><strong>Reading\nthe early verses of John 7, we notice that the writer\u2019s focus\nshifts from Jesus\u2019 private life to the public domain, from\nfamiliarity to the unknown.

As his\ncommunity, family and friends travel to Jerusalem with a sense of\nanticipation and joy, Jesus travels as a lone and solitary figure. He\ndoesn\u2019t want to draw attention to himself or put others at risk.\nNor does he feel the need to prove himself or to rush into Jerusalem\nwith blazing authority. He just quietly approaches the place of\nconflict, because he feels secure in his Father. But soon the secrecy\nof this arrival will be shattered. </strong></p><p><strong>To\nadd to the tension, John informs us that at the Feast,  \u2018\u2026the\nJewish leaders were watching for Jesus and asking, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n(NIV1984)</strong></p><p><strong>Even\nbefore he arrives into the city, Jesus has already been singled out\nfor surveillance.

When\nthe other rabbis taught, they would always cite other authorities\n(i.e. widely respected rabbis): \u201cAccording to Rabbi Hillel...\u201d\n\u201cAh, but Rabbi Shammai says...\u201d But Jesus never quotes other\nrabbis.

One of the reasons why people find it hard to\nhandle hostility is because they often feel that their source of life\nis being threatened.

Yet not one of you keeps the law.\u2019</strong></span></p><p><strong>We\nneed to keep in mind that the context of what Jesus is saying here is\nhis previous visit to Jerusalem when he healed the man at the pool of\nBethesda on the Sabbath. The Jewish leaders were accusing Jesus of\nbeing a lawbreaker because of that episode. But in reality </strong><em><strong>they</strong></em><strong>\nwere the real lawbreakers. Often in hostile situations people can\naccuse innocent people of the very sin of which they are guilty. </strong></p><p><strong>2.\nThey have murder in their hearts</strong></p><p><em><strong>John\n7:19b </strong></em><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><em><strong>\u201cWhy\nare you trying to kill me?\u201d</strong></em></span></p><p><strong>The\nfact that they have murderous intentions shows us that they are\nguilty of not keeping the law. Any unjustified hostility towards\nanother person is evidence of a murderous heart.</strong></p><p><strong>3.\nThey are inconsistent.</strong></p><p><strong>John\n7:21-22 </strong><strong>\u201cI\ndid one miracle, and you are all amazed. Yet, because Moses gave you\ncircumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from\nthe patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath Now if a boy can\nbe circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be\nbroken, why are you angry with me for healing a man\u2019s whole body on\nthe Sabbath?</strong></p><p><strong>These\nsame people accused Jesus of defiling the Sabbath because he healed a\nman. Yet they practised circumcision on the Sabbath. They honestly\nthought that it was acceptable for them to break the Sabbath by doing\nthe work of circumcision, but it was not all right for Jesus to heal\non that same day. Unjust hostility reflects inconsistency and double\nstandards.</strong></p><p><strong>4.\nThey make superficial judgements.</strong></p><p><strong>John\n7:2e </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><em><strong>\u201cStop\njudging by mere appearance, and make the right judgment.\u201d</strong></em></span></p><p><strong><br/>\nUnjust\nhostility is usually based on wrong conclusions, superficial\njudgments and ignorance of the facts. When we judge situations,\ncircumstances or people on appearance, we will make a wrong\nassumption and draw incorrect conclusions. Judging by appearance is\nan expression of unrighteousness, judging by appearance is refusing\nto look at the heart of a matter; it is making a superficial\nresponse, which in turn encourages hostility.  </strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhat are we to do with hostility? </strong></p><p><strong>On\nthat day in Jerusalem, as Jesus spoke in the temple, trying to be\nheard by those who did not know him, love him or understand him, he\nmust have felt emotionally drained. It\u2019s easy to overlook such\nrealities, but we must keep in mind that although Jesus was God he\nwas also fully human. As such he taught us how to handle the pain and\nconfusion of hostility. </strong></p><p><strong>Many\npeople read passages like John 7 through a theological lens, but\nprimarily it is a practical passage to help us know Jesus better, and\nto help us to become better people in the face of our own hostility.\nHow we handle hostility is a real reflection of our spirituality and\nour relationship with God. It is so easy to feel insecure and\nthreatened when we are being treated badly and misunderstood. </strong></p><p><strong>Like\nJesus, we need to constantly find our security in God, so when\nhostility comes we will not fall apart, but will be secure in Him.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhelp me understand those who may be hostile towards me.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Acts 27:9-28:31 Romans 1:1-15.</p>",

They wanted to be liked,\nthey wanted to be thought highly off, they wanted to be looked upon\nwith a sense of respect, they wanted to be considered to be spiritual\nand they wanted the seal of approval from others. So their whole life\nwas about how others saw them. Why were they driven by insecurities? \nlet me say, as we have mentioned before that the Fatherhood of God is\nmentioned more in this chapter than any other chapter in the bible. </strong></p><p><strong>When\nour focus is on how we look, and when the approval of others is\nessential for life, then we will never be able to be honest or real.\nSo often how we look is so disconnected from how we are.

In our day\nwe have fallen into the same trap, we think if a person goes to\nchurch, reads their bible, has a quiet time, wares the right cloths,\nand reads a certain version of the bible then they must be okay\nspiritually.

No one would ever say, \u2018I don\u2019t\nwant the grace of God,\u2019 it is not something we would ever verbalise\nor even recognise.  But we can develop an attitude that causes us to\nresist and refuse God\u2019s grace. It is possible for any one of us to\ndevelop a mindset, or have a world view that will cause us to develop\na default position of resisting grace. Our understanding of God and\nour relationship with him is viewed in such a way, that our natural\nresponse will be to try and live without grace.

When you read the\nparables of Jesus you should always look for the \u2018sting in the\ntale,\u2019 the ending is never quite what you expect or hope for. So\nwhen you read the story of the prodigal son you are surprised to\nrealise that the real prodigal is not the younger son who squandered\nhis resources, but the elder brother who squandered his life, because\nhe refused to understand grace, or receive it. </strong></p><p><strong>Before\nwe look at this story, I think it is important to mention the\ncultural context of the story. One commentator Kenneth Bailey points\nout, that it is hard for us to imagine how insulting the older son's\nbehaviour was to his father. He suggests that we imagine a wealthy\nman having a black tie, candle lit dinner for prestigious guests,\nonly to have his son show up at the door unshaven, without shirt and\nshoes, and begin to verbally attack the father. According to Bailey,\nthis analogy is too mild to convey the revolting nature of the older\nson's behaviour. He suggests that the behaviour of this son is\nactually more cutting than the behaviour of the youngest son at the\nbeginning of the story. At least that disrespect was done in private.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nare going look at his attitudes that made it impossible for him to\nreceive the grace of his father, and how the lack of grace affected\nhim.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nelder son ran from the father into the activity of service. The first\nthing we are told about the elder son is, \u2018Meanwhile, the elder son\nwas in field.\u2019  This is not a throw away statement but a succinct\ndescription of how the elder son lived, and what he lived for. The\nfield was a symbol that summed up his life. He was the kind of person\nwho tried to medicate his pain by doing, and found his value and\nsignificance in what he achieved. He buried himself in doing to\ncompensate for his poor relationship with his father. In Christian\ncircles people often fall into the trap of becoming too busy that\nthey cannot really grasp what is important to the father. </strong></p><p><strong>Hard\nwork is a good thing, but when our work becomes a place where we hide\nfrom dealing with the reality of our own hearts, then it is wrong,\nand this was the sin of the elder brother. Sometimes we use Christian\nservice as a smoke screen to hide the real us.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe fall into the mindset that puts too high a value on service we\nbecome incapable of receiving or enjoying the grace of God because\nour lives will be all about us trying to meet our own needs and\nmedicate our own pain. Serving God is a wonderful thing if it is not\nbeing used to replace intimacy with the father. We will only\nexperience healing and fullness in the embrace of the father.\nSometimes our emptiness or baroness can drive us into service. If we\nwere in the world we might turn to drugs, alcohol, materialism or\nsome other vice to medicate our pain. Often Christian service can\nbecome \u2018vice like,\u2019 for it is used as means of anaesthetising\nourselves from the pain of reality..</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nmay I never use Christian service to anaesthetise my pain but let me\nbe healed by your grace.</strong></p><p><strong>I\ndo not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be\ngained through the law, </strong><strong>\nChrist died for nothing.   </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n Meanwhile, the older son was in the field.

On the\nsurface, the elder brothers reasoning seemed to be completely\njustified.

Our devotion is sustained with the hope that God will keep his\nside of the bargain.

In the Greek translation of the Old Testament, Septuagint, the word is often translated unfaithful or betray, to rebel and scorn. The Christians in Galatia had developed a resistant posture towards God\u2019s grace; they were beginning to treat the grace of God as an unwanted gift. want to is try and examine the attitudes and mindset that prevents a person from receiving the grace of God.

The older brother\nwas so angry.  (The Greek word for angry is orgizo which means\n\"passionate rage.\" It comes from the root word orgao which\nreferred to plants and fruits swelling with juice to the point of\nbursting.) The older brother in the parable was so filled with rage\nthat he was ready to burst! He was \"so mad he could have\nexploded!\" The word also implies an abiding habit of the mind. \nLook at what he says about his younger brother. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018But\nwhen this son of yours who has squandered your property with\nprostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him.\u2019</strong></span></p><p><strong>Anger\nand grace are incompatible. Now we all know that Jesus got angry, but\nhis anger was always against injustice and the suffering of others.\nIt was never an expression of wounded pride, or selfish thinking, or\nself pity. Often our anger is about having our toes stood on, or our\nfeelings hurt and it can be an expression of selfishness. Grace heals\na persons heart, anger is an indication the healing is needed. Angry\npeople are usually those who have a host of issues they have not\ndealt with. Their anger may be the result of mishandling their pain.\nSometimes, anger is the thing people resort to when they are feeling\nvulnerable or insecure, they use their anger to try and control the\nsituation.  The gentle grace of God can calm the anger that rages in\na person\u2019s heart.</strong></p><p><strong>He\nlived like a slave, not as son.  He forgot who he really was; he\nsuffered from an identity crisis. He said to his father </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><em><strong>\u2018Look!\nAll these years I\u2019ve been slaving for you!</strong></em></span><em><strong>\nHe did not see himself in terms of being a son involved in a joint\nenterprise with his father, but as a begrudging slave trapped in\nresentment and animosity. </strong></em><strong>\nIf only he could accept who his father was, and who he was. If he\ncould but realise as a son of this father, he was going to be the\nrecipient of grace.  When we forget who we are, refusing to realise\nthat we are completely accepted and loved by God, we will begin to\nstruggle with receiving grace, developing a slavish adherence to a\nset of rules and expectations with no ability to cultivate the\nintimacy of a healthy relationship with our Father.   One of Satans\ngreatest and most effective weapons is to rob us of the joy of being\nthe children of God. When Jesus was in the wilderness He came under\nthe same attack when his identity was challenged.  \u2018If you are the\nSon of God...\u2019      This elder brother had stopped thinking and\nacting like a son. This change in his thinking was gradual. As he\nbegan to get value and significance from what he was doing, the less\nhe was able to enjoy it. </strong></p><p><strong>He\nlacked honesty about himself and honesty with his father. Reading the\nelder brothers assessment of himself, it appears that he had little\nif any self-awareness. He was blind to his own faults; he refused to\nrecognise his own short comings and sin. He uses exaggerated language\nto cover his is sin.</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n\u2018I have never disobeyed your orders!</strong></span><strong>\u2019\n  </strong></p><p><strong>At\ntimes we all suffer from blind spots, we all can become ignorant to\nthe stuff that is going on inside our own hearts, it is important\nthat see our sin for what it is, and although this is painful, it is\nfreeing and opens us up to receive grace. There are other people who\nconstantly see their sin, they are constantly feeling guilty and\nbelittling themselves, this too is wrong, and can prevent a person\nfrom receiving grace, because they believe their sin is greater than\nthe grace of God. God wants us to be honest about ourselves but not\ncrush ourselves under self condemnation.</strong></p><p><strong>He\nwas full of resentment and bitterness towards his brother. </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u2018This\nson of yours has wasted your wealth with prostitutes!\u2019</strong></span><strong>\n This was much more than a cruel slander, after an accusation like\nthat, if he can make it stick, no one is ever going to marry the guy,\nno family is ever going to give their daughter to this man. </strong></p><p><strong>We\nhave been made to receive and share grace; it is a basic inbuilt\ndefault position. However, if we are refusing to receive grace, then\nwe will not have the essential ability we will need to cope with the\ndifficulties that are part of everyday normal relationships and we\nwill end up becoming bitter lonely people with an incapacity for\ncelebration and joy.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsaddest thing about this elder son was that he was unable to\nunderstand or grasp his father\u2019s heart. He didn\u2019t really get his\nfather. What was important to his father was not important to him. He\ncould not grasp why his father would be so kind and loving towards\nhis brother.  Grace isn\u2019t fair and never will be.  If we all got\nwhat we deserved we would be on a road to hell!  So there\u2019s no\npoint in trying to understand it from any other position other than,\nit\u2019s what God wants for us! </strong></p><p><strong>When\nGod pours his grace into our lives, it is one of the ways he teaches\nus about who he is. It is a means of revelation; it is how he shares\nhis heart with us. The younger son received the father grace and\ncould enter into his father\u2019s joy, the elder son couldn\u2019t.   </strong></p><p><strong>Three\nprincipals that help us live in grace.</strong></p><p><strong>Recognise\nthe difference between having a relationship with the father and\nhaving fellowship with the father in that we may call ourselves\nChristians but not have intimacy with Him.  </strong></p><p><strong>Being\nreal is more important than how we appear.</strong></p><p><strong>Being\na child is more important than service.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nit is so easy to have angry heart like the older brother and not\nshare your heart.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Ephesians 1:15-5:14</p>",

Now then, my son, do\nwhat I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran. Stay with him\nfor a while until your brother\u2019s fury subsides. When your brother\nis no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I\u2019ll\nsend word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of\nyou in one day?\u201d Then Rebecca said to Isaac, \u201cI\u2019m disgusted\nwith living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife\nfrom among the women of this land from Hittite women like these, my\nlife will not be worth living.\u201d</strong><strong>\nGenesis 27</strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes\nwhen read the bible it can be very difficult because the passage we\nare reading from is extremely practical, and because it is so\npractical, it confronts, challenges and disturbs us. Sometimes we\nwould rather listen to teaching that is doctrinal or theological,\nteaching that feeds</strong><u><strong>\n</strong></u><strong>our\nminds. However, if we are being taught something that is very\npractical, then we are more tempted to disengage, to switch of. What\nwe want to look at a passage that is very practical, and extremely\nrelevant to everyone.</strong></p><p><strong>Before\nwe look at this passage let me start by saying that the nature and\nquality </strong><u><strong>of</strong></u><strong>\na persons relationship with God is primarily displayed in the context\nof the family. In other words, if we were able to watch your family\ndynamics we would have a clear picture of what kind of love you have\nfor God.  What is life like behind the closed door of your home? </strong></p><p><strong>Also,\nit is interesting that the most comprehensive teaching about\nspiritual warfare in the New Testament is found in the context of\nPaul teaching about healthy family relationships in Ephesians 5 and\n6. Christian family is something that Satan hates, and so he will do\nall he can to turn family life into a \u2018war zone,\u2019 or a centre for\n\u2018crisis management. In saying that, this fact in no way removes us\nfrom our responsibilities</strong></p><p><strong>As\nChristians who are followers of Jesus, it is important that we live\nas families that seek and honour God, however, for some Christians,\nfamily life has slowly become dysfunctional, their homes have ceased\nto be a sacred space, set apart for love and nourishment.  I remember\nbeing shocked by a young girls story, of how her abusive father was\nan elder in a local evangelical church. Dysfunctionality within any\nfamily is never an objective or a goal,  no family seta out to be\ndysfunctional. it is the evolving consequence of attitudes and\nactions we express and do through the course of our everyday lives.</strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhat can we learn from our story.</strong></p><p><strong>1.\n When love dies, so does joy.</strong></p><p><strong>Reading\nthrough our passage it is very obvious that Isaac and Rebekah were no\nlonger in love with each other.  The bible describes in detail their\naffection for each other when they first met. Look at these verses\nfrom Genesis 24:</strong><strong>62-67.\n</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Meanwhile,\nIsaac, whose home was in the Negev, had returned from Beer-lahai-roi\nOne evening as he was walking and meditating in the fields, he looked\nup and saw the camels coming. When Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac,\nshe quickly dismounted from her camel.\u201cWho is that man walking\nthrough the fields to meet us?\u201d she asked the servant. </strong><strong>And\nhe replied, \u201cIt is my master.\u201d So Rebekah covered her face with\nher veil. Then the servant told Isaac everything he had done. And\nIsaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah\u2019s tent, and she became\nhis wife. He loved her deeply, and she was a special comfort to him\nafter the death of his mother. </strong><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>The\nmention of love in marriage is not always found in Hebrew story\nbecause most marriages were arranged by the families of the couple.\nBut for Isaac and Rebekah there was a strong emotional commitment to\neach other. We are told that \u2018he loved her deeply\u2019 However, by\nthe time we get to chapter 27, their love for each other had become\nsomething in the past. The pain and challenges of life caused them to\nstop loving each other. They were together and not together at the\nsame time.</strong></p><p><strong>There\ncan be situations and circumstances where no matter how much you try,\nor how much you choose to love, you will not be able to reach the\nother person. However, as Christians, we have a God given obligation\nto make a deliberate choice to continually love our spouse and\nverbally and practically express that love daily. As we read through\nthis chapter we get a warning that the homes of people who have a\nrelationship with God can imperceptibly erode into places of\ndysfunctionality where there is no joy.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you for the amazing honour of loving our spouses for the rest\nof our lives.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Ephesians</p>",

I think in this incident Isaac\u2019s loss of physical\nvision was a symbol or a pointer to his loss of his spiritual vision.\nThis lack of vision affected him in a number of ways.</strong></p><p><strong>When\nyou read Genesis 27:1 you could easily get the impression that Isaac\nwas on his deathbed, but he wasn\u2019t, in fact he lived for a further\n43 years. It is as if he had given up on life, maybe he thought God\nhad finished with him. So he died before his death.</strong></p><p><strong>Also\nnotice that his lack of vision made him self centered, and caused him\nto live out of his feelings not by faith. Look at these words.</strong></p><p><strong>2\u201cI\nam an old man now,\u201d Isaac said, \u201cand I don\u2019t know when I may\ndie. 3.Take your bow and a quiver full of arrows, and go out into the\nopen country to hunt some wild game for me. 4.Prepare my favorite\ndish, and bring it here for me to eat.

In verses 2\u20134 Isaac\nrefers to himself 8 times \u2018 I, me, my.\u2019 For him life had been\nreduced to having his desires and appetite met. As you read through\nthe chapter you will notice that because Isaac was loosing his\nvision, he became more dependent on his senses. From a physical\nperspective this is completely understandable. However, when we begin\nto loose our spiritual vision we will go through life dependent on\nwhat we can relate to through our senses. So we think is terms of\n\u2018what feels right!\u2019  When we live on the basis of our senses,\nlooking for instant gratification of our desires or appetites, we\nbecome less discerning.</strong></p><p><strong>This\nwas a family where there was no healthy communication. </strong></p><p><strong>If\nyou were to read chapters 27:1-28-5 you will notice that there are\nseven short conversations. </strong><strong>1.\nIsaac and Esau 27:1-4.  2.

For example when you eat your meals, don\u2019t have a\ntelevision or any other device distracting you. Make meal time a\ndevice free zone.</strong></p><p><strong>e.\nWhen communication happens naturally or spontaneously then let it\nhappen.

Remember\nthis was God who wrestled with Jacob and gave him a permanent\ndisability, this is not the kind of God that we want, but it is the\nkind of God that we sometimes need. If we were to find ourselves in\nJacobs situation, were we were frightened and distressed, [see verse\n7,] we would want a cuddle, we would want some comfort, some\nencouragement and sympathy.   Not a night long exhausting wrestling\nmatch, not a painful dislocated hip, not a permanent disability that\nwould change how you would do life from here on.</strong></p><p><strong>It\nmay be the reason we do not expect to experience God in this way is\nbecause our understanding of salvation has been distorted. When we\ncommonly think about salvation we are used to understanding it in\nterms of being saved from hell and judgement, and going to spend\neternity in heaven with Jesus, which of course is absolutely true.\nHowever, heaven is not God\u2019s ultimate goal of salvation.  Getting\nto heaven will be wonderful, but in some ways that is the easy part.\nListen to these words written by Paul.</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Long\nago, even before he made the world, God loved us and chose in Christ\nto be holy and without fault in his eyes.\u2019 Ephesians 1:4.This verse\nexpresses God\u2019s ultimate goal of salvation. To make us holy, to\ncompletely transform us, to make us like Jesus, and that is the hard\npart. Because sin is so ingrained in our hearts and minds, the only\nway we can be experience the freedom of sanctification is to have, at\ntimes, a dangerous encounter with God that will threaten the people\nwe have become, and transform us into the people we need to be. You\ncould say that the transforming grace of God, is God way of saving me\nfrom myself. Saving me from the ultimate threat my own heart is to\nauthentic spiritual maturity. This means that their will be times we\nwill need encounter painful grace when God decides to wrestle us.

We know that Jacob is\nfrightened and distressed, see verse 7. Surely he needs comfort,\nencouragement, strengthening not an exhausting long night of\nwrestling. Why would God want to wrestle someone? Maybe it is only\nthrough the wrestle that God can get as close to us as he needs to\nbe?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>It\nwas through the discomfort of being in the grip of Gods arms that\nJacob realised who and what he really was. As God wrestled Jacob,\nJacob discovered how needy and helpless he really was</strong></em><em><strong>.\nIt was through the wrestling that Jacob came to an end of himself.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Sometimes\nin our relationship with God there needs to be a threatening\nintensity, there is so much in our lives that need to be threatened\nby God. Our desire for independence and control, our need to be in\ncharge and our sense of feeling we need to fix every situation. Or we\nneed to appear strong, able, competent. God needs to threaten the\nmindset that believes we can manipulate others and\ncircumstances,[something Jacob had done all his life.]  If God does\nnot threaten our engraved selfish mindsets, we will choose to live\nlives that are all about us.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Our\ntransformation and holiness is so important to God, which means there\nare times when He, in his great grace, will have to wrestle with us.\nThis wrestling will threaten and remove the heart attitudes and our\nperverted thinking that prevents authentic, radical change.</strong></em></p><p><strong>Look\nat these words from Hosea</strong></p><p><em>\u2018<strong>Even\nin the womb, Jacob struggled with his brother; when he became a man,\nhe even fought with God. Yes, he wrestled with the angel and won. He\nwept and pleaded for a blessing from him. There at Bethel he met God\nface to face, and God spoke to him.\u2019 Hosea 12:3-4. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>These\nwords describe Jacob\u2019s reaction to the wrestling of God. He wept\nand pleaded for a blessing. Here is the thing, this is the first time\nin his life that Jacob felt a desperate need of God, it was a\ndesperation that was expressed through dependence. As he encountered\nGod wrestling with him, the realisation of his true nature began to\ndawn on him. He discovered his need of grace as he wept and pleaded\nfor a blessing.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>3.\nGod gave Jacob a gift of weakness.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>We\nare told that \u2018The man struck Jacob\u2019s hip and knocked it out of\njoint at the socket.\u2019  It was through the wrestle that Jacob\ndiscovered the glories essential of weakness. For Jacob this was a\nnew and life saving discovery. This was a very painful and\ndebilitating experience for Jacob. For the first time in his life he\nwas unable to run. God had no choice for He knew that if he had not\ndislocated Jacobs hip he would have ran again. The pain of not being\nable to run was a severe mercy. It is interesting that it was only\nafter Jacob lost his ability to run that he was able to be honest and\nreal about himself, as we shall see.  </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The\ngift of weakness teaches us that God is more concerned with spiritual\ncharacter than he is with physical strength or ability. Sometimes in\nour hearts we are running away, we don\u2019t really want to engage with\nGod, we don\u2019t want to embrace the sanctifying process, we don\u2019t\nwant to deal with the stuff going on in our hearts. So God\n\u2018dislocates\u2019 us\u2026 he sends circumstances into our lives that\ncurtail and prohibit us from reaction and responding in the ways we\nhave always done. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>4.\nJacob became real about himself. We read in the NLT. \u2018But Jacob\npanted, \u2018I will not let you go unless you bless me.\u2019\u2019 \u2018What\nis your name?\u2019 the man asked. He replied \u2018Jacob.\u2019</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>This\nwas a penetrating question that goes way beyond a name tag. \u2018I am\nJacob, I am Jacob the liar, Jacob the cheat, Jacob the selfish\ncontroller, Jacob the manipulator. As God wrestled with him in the\ndark of night, he began to be self aware, he began to recognise and\naccept who he really was. Maybe for the first time he really saw and\nfelt the seriousness of his own sin and his need of grace. He once\nstole by lying about his identity (Genesis 27:19). In this instant,\nJacob can either continue to be a liar, and a deceiver, or he can be\nhonest about who he really is. It will take a painful, arduous,\nstruggle in God presence and a lot of courage before we can be honest\nwith ourselves about ourselves. This honesty is a prerequisite for\ntransformation.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>You\ndon\u2019t often read about Jacob referring to himself by his own name,\nfor he knew that to call himself Jacob was to be specific about his\nsin and character. Often we can view our sin in a generic way. We\nknow that we have sin, but we don\u2019t deal specifically with our sin.\nIt is something like going to see a doctor and saying \u2018I feel ill.\u2019\nthe fact that you feel ill is true, but unless you are are a bit more\nspecific, the doctor will be limited in the help he/she can give.\nThis same principle applies when it comes to dealing with the power\nof sin in our lives. Part of Gods wrestle with us is to expose the\nJacob within us, to bring us to the place of heart-breaking yet\nliberating honesty.  </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>5.\nWrestling with God led to Jacob receiving a new identity.</strong></em></p><p><em>\u2018<strong>Your\nname shall no longer be Jacob,\u2019 the man told him. \u2018It is now\nIsrael,\u2019 because you have struggled with God and men and have won.\u2019\nThere is a lot of debate about what the precise meaning of the name\nIsrael is. Some think it means to contend with God, others think it\ncould mean, \u2018let God reign.\u2019  or \u2018God prevails.\u2019 </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Although\nwe cannot be certain of the precise meaning of Israel we can be\ncertain of a number of things.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>a.\nJacob got a new identity through the wrestle.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I\ndon\u2019t think we can be or accept who we are until we begin to become\nthe person God wants us to be. Maybe our lack of self-acceptance, our\ninsecurities, our self loathing could be because we have no idea of\nthe person God wants us to become. God wrestling with us causes the\npain that helps us discover a new and better identity.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>b.\nThe purposes of God for our lives are intrinsically linked to our\nidentity. Israel was more than a new name for Jacob, it would become\nthe name of a great nation who would redefine the whole history of\nthe world. Who we are in God, and what we do with and for God are\ninseparable.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>c.\nI love the fact that there is a lot of debate about the meaning of\nthe name Israel.

The work\nof God in us is not always easy to understand or simplify, that what\nit is like to become an \u2018Israel.\u2019</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Conclusion.\n</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>We\nbegan with the words of Mr Beaver to Lucy about Aslam, how he was\ngood but not safe.

    "html": "<p><strong>For\nmy own part, I didn\u2019t always find family life easy. One of the many\nreasons for this was that I spent most of my childhood living away\nfrom home in a school that was dedicated to the needs of disabled\nchildren. This prevented me from getting to know my brothers and\nsisters properly as I was growing up and it\u2019s only recently that\nI\u2019ve recognised how this contributed to us not connecting as\nfamilies should. Like me I\u2019m sure you can think of times in your\nfamily life when it wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d hoped or needed it to be,\nwhen life behind the front door wasn\u2019t easy. </strong></p><p><strong>Getting\nstarted</strong></p><p><strong>It\nwasn\u2019t until the 17</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>\nCentury that the term \u2018family\u2019 was used specifically for the\ngroup of persons consisting of parents and their children. It\ninitially referred to the servants of a household \u2013 </strong><em><strong>famulus</strong></em><strong>\nbeing the Latin for 'the servant'. Perhaps, in our families, there is\nsomething here for us to embrace. The role of each member of a family\nis surely to serve, rather than control or \u2018use\u2019 one another.\nServing each other can help us to avoid dysfunctional family\nrelationships. As we will see, such a servant attitude would have\nbeen very helpful to the brothers of Jesus before the </strong><em><strong>Feast\nof Tabernacles</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>We\nwant look at a difficult encounter Jesus had with his own family. In\nsome ways this is were we need to start, because how we handle\nconflict and tension with those in our own household can often\ninfluence how we handle the conflicts and tensions we will face\noutside our front door. </strong></p><p><strong>Setting\nthe Scene: The family of Jesus</strong></p><p><strong>After\nthis, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea\nbecause the Jews there were waiting to take his life. But when the\nJewish Feast of Tabernacles was near, Jesus\u2019 brothers said to him,\n\u201cYou ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples\nmay see the miracles you do. No one who wants to become a public\nfigure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show\nyourself to the world.\u201d For even his own brothers did not believe\nin him.</strong></p><p><strong>Therefore\nJesus told them, </strong><strong>\u201cThe\nright time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right. The\nworld cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it\ndoes is evil. You go to the Feast. I am not yet going up to this\nFeast, because for me the right time has not yet come.\u201d</strong><strong>\nHaving said this, he stayed in Galilee.</strong></p><p><strong>However,\nafter his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not\npublicly, but in secret.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nwas a member of a large family, the eldest of at least </strong><strong>seven\nchildren. In the Gospel accounts, </strong><strong>four\nbrothers are named and at least two sisters (because the plural is\nused). See </strong>Matthew\n13:55 and Mark 6:3.</p><p><strong>If\nyou\u2019ve ever thought that Jesus must have come from a perfect\nfamily, then think again! Like any other family, the family of Jesus\nwasn\u2019t immune to stress and tension. The Gospel accounts give us a\nnumber of indications of such tension. For example, when Mark says\nJesus\u2019 family were \u2018offended\u2019 by him (6:3), the word can mean\n\u2018</strong><strong>to\njudge unfavourably or unjustly\u2019. In Mark 3:21, we read that Jesus\u2019\nfamily thought he was \u2018out of his mind\u2019,  John also records an\nepisode of likely tension between Jesus and his family John 7:10. The\nScriptures portray the family of Jesus as one where conflict and\nmisunderstanding were a reality.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\n\t\tstays in Galilee</strong></p><p><strong>Before\nJohn tells us about Jesus\u2019 time at the </strong><em><strong>Feast\nof Tabernacles</strong></em><strong>,\nhe gives us some important information about Jesus, his brothers and\nthe reason he delayed his journey to Jerusalem. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nhas been away from Jerusalem for about a year. The last time he was\nthere is recorded for us in John Chapter 5. At that time he sparked\ngreat controversy by healing a paralysed man on the Sabbath. The\nreligious authorities were outraged and sought to kill him \u2013 not\nbecause of this amazing work of power and grace, but because they\nbelieved he broke a Sabbath rule. </strong></p><p><strong>The\nevents recorded in John Chapter 6 begin \u2018some time after\u2019 this\nvisit to Jerusalem and the chapter goes on to recount some stories\nabout Jesus in and around Galilee.

Then, we read the opening verses of Chapter 7</strong></p><p><em><strong>After\nthis Jesus went around Galilee purposely staying away from Judea\nbecause the Jews there wanted to kill him.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Father\nthank you that Jesus understands how difficult family life can be </strong></em></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 1 Timothy 1-5</p>",

So, for a period of time, he\nremained in Galilee.</strong></p><p><strong>It\u2019s\nworth noting that despite Jesus\u2019 eagerness to do the Father\u2019s\nwill, he did not rush into things.

It certainly wasn\u2019t\nfor Jesus. In the six-month period between the feeding of the 5000 at\nPassover time in John 6, and the events in John 7, he poured his life\ninto his disciples, teaching and encouraging them. It is very easy\nfor us to underestimate how important our time on earth is.

As a\ndevoted Jew, Jesus also knew that it was required that every male\nshould attend the annual </strong><em><strong>Feast\nof Tabernacles</strong></em><strong>\nin Jerusalem. So as the time comes for the Feast, Jesus has some very\ncourageous choices to make.</strong></p><p><strong>Try\nto imagine the kind of pressure Jesus must be under at this time. The\n</strong><em><strong>Feast\nof Tabernacles</strong></em><strong>\nwas a very important event for the community. Everyone was involved.\nAs the head of the family unit, Jesus would have been expected by all\nnot only to go to Jerusalem, but to lead his family to the Feast. </strong></p><p><strong>But\nas the community prepare themselves for the journey, Jesus shows no\nsign of joining them.</strong></p><p><strong>In\nverses 3 and 4, we read that his brothers come to him, saying:</strong></p><p>\u201c<em><strong>You\nought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see\nthe miracles you do. No one who wants to be a public figure acts in\nsecret. Since you are doing these things show yourself to the world.\u201d</strong></em></p><p><strong>There\nare two things worth noticing before we look more closely at these\nverses.</strong></p><p><strong>Firstly,\nif his brothers had really cared for Jesus they would not have made\nthis suggestion. Even though the law required every male to attend\nthe Feast, they know that the authorities in Jerusalem want to kill\nJesus, yet they seem quite happy for him to go there. </strong></p><p><strong>Furthermore\nwe must keep in mind that they are speaking out of unbelief. In the\nnext verse (v5), John says, </strong><em><strong>\u2018For\neven his brothers did not believe in him\u2019. </strong></em><strong>In\nother words they have no confidence in him, they doubt him, and they\ndo not trust him. So the suggestion for Jesus to \u2018go public\u2019 in\nJudea is more an expression of doubt than encouragement.  </strong></p><p><strong>A\nlack of care and a lack of confidence what a deadly cocktail! </strong></p><p><strong>In\neffect, Jesus brothers seem to be saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t really care\nwhat happens to you because we have no confidence in you, so we\nsuggest that you go.\u201d </strong></p><p><strong>From\nour own experience, we know that such thoughtless and insensitive\nundertones can make a person react.

We want to show them, we want to prove ourselves. To put\nourselves in this story, many of us would be tempted to take things\nout of God\u2019s hands and go to Jerusalem to make a point. Surely it\nwould be easier to face the murderous cruelty of loveless strangers\nthan the misunderstanding or suspicion of a family whom we love?

John is\nsuggesting that something in the brother\u2019s response reflects this\nlack of confidence and trust in Jesus. As we look at their words\ncarefully we will notice there are four parts to what they say:</strong></p><p>\u201c<em><strong>You\nought to leave here and go to Jerusalem so your disciples may see the\nmiracles you do.\u201d</strong></em></p><p><strong>It\nis possible that the larger than life presence of Jesus in Galilee\ncould had</strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\n</strong></span><strong>made\nhis brothers feel small and insignificant. Jesus is the talk of the\ntown they aren\u2019t; so perhaps they think that if Jesus was to go\nJerusalem, leave Galilee, move out, leave home, then they might be\nnoticed. Maybe they believe that they would be happier if Jesus\nwasn\u2019t around. Instead of trying to work at their relationship with\nJesus, they choose the easy option of trying to create some distance\nbetween themselves and him. The word John uses for \u2018leave\u2019 does\nnot suggest a visit, or a trip, but carries the idea of changing\nhomes. This often happens when relationships become terse and\ndifficult; we think that creating some geographical distance will be\nthe solution to internal conflict. </strong></p><p><strong>This\nmight appear to be a legitimate and innocent comment. </strong><em><strong>\u201cYou\nought to leave here and go to Jerusalem so your disciples may see the\nmiracles you do.\u201d </strong></em><strong>After\nall, Jesus has been performing miracles in Galilee and many there are\nbelieving in him. Surely, the same thing could happen in Jerusalem.\nBut in light of the brothers \u2018unbelief\u2019 and lack of confident, it\nseems unlikely that such thinking was informing their\nsuggestion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy then do they make this comment? Are they\nbeing sarcastic? Perhaps they are suggesting that Jesus needs to\nprove himself. After the feeding of the 5000, many of Jesus\u2019\nfollowers deserted him. This may well have encouraged his brothers to\ndoubt that he was, indeed, sent by God. In telling Jesus to go to\nJerusalem and perform some miracles, they may be suggesting that he\nneeds to keep impressing his few remaining disciples if he wants to\nkeep them.</strong></p><p>\u201c<em><strong>No\none who wants to become a public figure acts in secret.\u201d</strong></em></p><p><strong>In\nsome senses this second part of the brothers\u2019 suggestion is the key\nthat really helps us understand what is going on in their hearts.\nThey perceive Jesus as someone who wants to be a \u2018public figure.\u2019\nYes, crowds flock to Jesus, but he is not someone who seeks the\nlimelight. Often when Jesus healed people, he told them not to tell\nanyone. Jesus had the heart of a servant, he was born in obscurity\nand he lived amongst the poor. But his brothers seem to see him as\none who was eager for public recognition; this could not have been\nfarther from the truth. If they had really known Jesus they would not\nhave thought of him in this way. </strong></p><p>\u201c<em><strong>Since\nyou are doing these things, show yourself to the world.\u201d</strong></em></p><p><strong>On\nthe surface this may appear to be an innocent statement, but it\nisn\u2019t. Jesus\u2019 brothers seem to want him to operate on the same\ngrounds as most people operate. They want him to seek a name for\nhimself, they want him to promote himself, they want him to become\nambitious and be noticed. They may have been suggesting that his\ngifts were being wasted, and that he deserved to be seen by more\npeople. The advice which Jesus\u2019 brothers give him contained echoes\nof Satan\u2019s temptation of Jesus in the wilderness. \u201cJesus prove\nyourself, let people see what you can do, take control of the\nsituation, use your power to bolster your reputation.\u201d It is as\nthough Satan himself wants Jesus to go to Jerusalem to experience\npremature death.   </strong></p><p><strong>The\ndesire for glory and prestige is one of Satan\u2019s most effective\nweapons. Satan comes to us under the guise of ambition and tells us\nthat we deserve the best, we deserve to be top cat, and we have\nearned the right to be in charge. He says to us: \u201cGo show yourself\nto the world.\u201d And because of the illegitimate pursuit of praise,\nposition and prestige we become slaves to our desires and victims of\nSatan. The self-promoting attitude that Satan encourages prevents a\nperson from taking up their cross, and hinders them in their ability\nto cope with the tension of difficult relationships. </strong></p><p><strong>Father\nplease may I have  the  spiritual maturity to handle the\nmisunderstanding of others.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Titus1-3 Philemon 1 Hebrews 1:1-2:10</p>",

You're asking me to abandon\nthe appointed path that God has chosen, to go up to the </strong><em><strong>Feast\nof Tabernacles</strong></em><strong>\nand make it known to everybody that I am the Messiah. But if I did\nthat it would be at the wrong time: it would never work.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>As\nChristians it is important that we understand and accept God\u2019s\ntiming for our lives - often this is difficult. One of the ways Satan\nmakes this even more difficult is that he appeals to our pride. Pride\nmakes us impatient and discontent. Pride will cause us to take things\ninto our own hands and act prematurely in order to enhance our own\nreputation. Pride is more about our timing and our agenda, not God\u2019s.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nis able to resist the temptation contained in the suggestion of his\nbrothers because he is free from pride and accepts the timing of his\nFather. When we struggle to accept God\u2019s timing for our lives, it\ncan be more difficult to resist the temptations that Satan may throw\nat us through the wrong expectations of others, especially those of\nour own families.</strong></p><p><strong>The\ntension between the expectations of others and the timing of God is\nsomething every Christian has to live with and the only way we can\nlive comfortably with that tension is to consciously accept that\nGod\u2019s timing is always right. It is an expression of His love and\nkindness towards us. Accepting this will prevent us from running away\nfrom unwanted situations and people that we need to have in our\nlives.  </strong></p><p><strong>For\nJesus, following his brothers\u2019 suggestion would have been, in some\nsenses, the easy option. He could have gone to Jerusalem and\ndemonstrated his power and glory; he could have destroyed those who\nwanted to kill him. After all, he was God. But he chooses instead to\nstay in submission to his Father and suffer the misunderstanding and\nsarcastic scorn of his family.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nhas a realistic understanding of the situation. He realises that his\nbrothers are not thinking in terms of God\u2019s purpose or God\u2019s\ntiming.</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nsays to them, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><em><strong>\u201c..for\nyou any time is right.\u201d</strong></em></span><strong>\nHe means that if his brothers go up to the feast they will only be\nfulfilling what everybody expects of them. They would be acting as\nnormal religious Jews, fulfilling a religious duty, which would not\nirritate anybody, raise any questions or challenge any beliefs.\nTherefore, they could act without fear of arousing antagonism or\nopposition. However, Jesus doesn\u2019t have that luxury. He would be\nclosely watched by the religious authorities, who would monitor his\nevery move, hoping he would make some mistake or say something out of\nturn, so they could incriminate him. </strong></p><p><strong>When\nwe are put under pressure from the expectations, demands and\nmisunderstandings of others, we need to ask God for the wisdom to see\nbeyond what they are asking. We need His help to see the whole\npicture and the possible consequences of their illegitimate demands. </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\u2019\nbrothers don\u2019t think in terms of God\u2019s timing, they think in\nterms of being \u2018free\u2019 \u2013 free to do what they want, when they\nwant. They don\u2019t see the need for being submitted and committed to\nGod and His timing. This was a collision of mindsets and perceptions\nand this made conflict inevitable.   </strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nunderstood the world in which he lived</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\ncontinues by saying, </strong><span class=\"red\" style=\"color:#c00\"><strong>\u201cThe\nworld cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it\ndoes is evil.\u201d</strong></span><strong>\n</strong></p><p><strong>The\nword \u2018hate\u2019 here comes from the ancient Greek word </strong><em><strong>miseo</strong></em><strong>.\nIf any synonym could substitute for this word, it would come from a\nword like \u2018detest,\u2019 \u2018loath,\u2019 or \u2018despise.\u2019 In effect,\nJesus is saying, \u201cYou are telling me to go up to the feast in\nJerusalem and make a name for myself, but why would I do that, for\nthe people you want me to impress are the people who despise me.\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>Jesus\nhas no intention of going to Jerusalem to seek the glory and praise\nof men, he isn\u2019t going to allow himself to be pressurised by the\nuncaring expectations of his brothers.

So when we think of work we\nautomatically think in terms of salary, wages, employment. We see it\nas means of generating enough income in order to pay the bills. If\nyou are working, and you generate an income because of your work,\nthat is great. But much of the work we do has nothing to do with\nreceiving an income. For example the full time mum at home looking\nafter children, she is working but not paid, the student at school or\nuniversity, they are working but not paid. The volunteer in the\nchurch or community, working but not paid.  When we think about the\ncreation of man, we are told that \u2018That the Lord God took man and\nput him in the garden of Eden to work it and take care of it,\u2019\nGenesis 2:15.

Is \u2018secular,\u2019 employment more\nvaluable than \u2018Christian,\u2019 employment? I think at some kind of\nlevel we which that this was the case. If we see the pastors,\nmissionaries, bible teacher, church workers as the really spiritual\njob, it takes the pressure of the plumber, the binman and any other\noccupation you care to mention, to be seen as a spiritual occupation.\nThe problem is, as far as the bible in concern nothing is \u2018secular,\u2019\nThe spiritual secular divide were categories devised by Plato to help\nhim understand his world. Their are many jobs that are wrong for a\nChristian because certain types of occupations depend upon living an\namoral life, i.e., a drug dealer, a thief, a prostitute.

After the Fall, it just got tougher, frustrating,\nexhausting, sometimes even boring.

Our work often\nprovides the opportunities to proclaim Him to a broken, unredeemed\nworld through our example, as well as by our words. Robert Tamasy\nSource unknown</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Some\npeople think that work is a necessary evil. Many people feel trapped\nin their places of work, be that paid or unpaid. How often have you\nheard things like, \u2018It\u2019s only a job, or \u2018I am only a \u2026?  and\nsometimes we develop an unhealthy mindset, or an unhelpful emotional\nrelationship with our work. Lets be honest, there are times when we\nare tired, or when things can be challenging, and at times we wish\nwere somewhere else doing something else. However sometimes people\ndevelop a default negativity towards work.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme ask a strange question that might help us develop a more positive\nattitude towards \u2018work\u2019  \u2018paid or unpaid.\u2019 \u2018Do you hate\nworship? I realise that this a shocking question, and may appear to\nbe unrelated. But did you know the Hebrew word </strong><em><strong>avodah</strong></em><strong>\njointly means work, worship, and service. The various usages of this\nHebrew word found first in Genesis 2:15 tell us that God\u2019s original\ndesign and desire is that our work and our worship would be a\nseamless way of living.  Every time we work we are also worshipping.\nIt may not feel like worship.

It is the Lord Christ you are serving.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhat can proverbs teach about our attitude towards work. In proverbs\nthere are two words that captivate the teachers attitude towards\nwork, one of the words is negative and the other is positive. The\nnegative word is laziness, often translated sluggard, and the\npositive word is diligence.  </strong></p><p><strong>1.\nWe need to avoid laziness. The book of proverbs introduces us to what\nsome versions of the bible refer to as the sluggard. The word for\nsluggard indicates someone who is slothful, indolent or slack. His\nlaziness is betrayed in a number of significant ways.</strong></p><p><strong>He\nlacks initiative. Solomon compares the life of the sluggard and the\naunt he says,  </strong></p><p><strong>Go\nto the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise! 7 It has no\ncommander, no overseer or ruler, yet it stores its provisions in\nsummer.<br/>\nand gathers its food at harvest. Proverbs 6:6-7</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsluggard lacks the ability to act. He has no vision, no motivation.\nProverbs has nothing good to say about the sluggard.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsluggard will always make an excuse for his inactivity. \u2018 listen to\nhis excuse. \u2018There a lion on the road, a fierce lion roaming the\nstreets Proverbs 26:13. This was a silly excuse, like the school\npupil telling their teacher \u2018the dog eat my homework,\u2019 a complete\nnonsense. It is interesting to note that the Hebrew for sluggard also\nmeans to be shifty or not upright. We create imaginary lions by lying\nto ourselves and others, we allow fear to drain us of diligence and\nzeal.   </strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>As\nthe door swings on it hinges so the sluggard turns on his bed\u2019\nProverbs 26:14. For this sluggard the bed became an icon of his\ndysfunctional life, for him life was all about, rest, ease, comfort,\nsafety, and warmth. Their will be times in all our lives when we need\nto feel the security of rest, but, if it becomes a lifestyle, a\nhabit, a means of avoiding responsible then it is wrong. Our icon may\nnot be a bed, it could be a hobby, a ministry even a job, where you\ngo to flee the realities and responsibilities of life.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsluggard refuses to take responsibility for himself. \u2018He buries his\nhand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.\u2019\nProverbs 26:15. He is too lazy to feed himself He starts something\nbut does not finish it, his life is littered with the unfinished.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nsluggard are incline to be unteachable, \u2018he is wiser in his own\neyes than seven people who answer discretely.\u2019 Proverbs 26:16</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nhep me be spiritually minded enough to  do my job,</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> Hebrews 11-13</p>",

This passage of\nscripture is holy ground, it is known as the fifth gospel, or the\nfirst gospel. One commentator said that it reads as if \u2018it was\nwritten at the foot of the cross.\u2019 No other passage in all of\nscripture allows us to come as close to the suffering of Jesus. No\nother passage makes the vulnerability and weakness of Jesus so vivid.\nThis passage draws into the very heart of God. It reveals God\u2019s\nthoughts, emotions, purposes, plans, judgement, justice, grace and\nlove. This chapter revels the depth of relationship between the\nFather and the Son. This chapter helps us to know and understand God,\nit is a window into the very soul of God, it takes us to the very\nessence of God and the reason for our existence. </strong></p><p><strong>Let\nme give you some facts about the chapter.</strong></p><p><strong>1.\nActually the chapter begins in chapter 52:13. it is known as the\nforth Servant song, the first three servant songs are found in </strong><strong>(I</strong><a href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/niv/Isa%2042.1-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>s\n42:1-7</strong></a><strong>;\n</strong><a href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/niv/Is%2049.1-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>49:1-9</strong></a><strong>;50:4-9)</strong><strong>\n this forth song Isa 52:13-53:12 is the longest, and is made up of\nfive stanzas of three verses each; Chapter 52:13-15, 53:1-3. 4-6. 7-9\nand 10-12. It is important to notice that this song starts and ends\nwith God speaking about the exaltation and victory of his servant,\nsee 52:13-15, 53:11b-12. These two passages describe his servant as a\nvictorious king who has defeated his enemies. They are talking about\nthe end of the story, about what will be accomplished through his\nsuffering.</strong></p><p><strong>2.\nUp until the 11th century, Jewish Rabbi\u2019s taught that this passage\nwas speaking about the coming Messiah.</strong><strong>\nThen, a completely different view was popularized by Jewish\ncommentator Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Itzchaki), who lived one thousand\nyears after Jesus.</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>Rashi\nbelieved that the servant passages of Isaiah referred to the\ncollective fate of the nation of Israel rather than a personal\nMessiah. To this day, many rabbis persist in citing Rashi as the\ndefinitive word on how to interpret Isaiah 53. Others do see the\nweakness of Rashi\u2019s view and say the passage applies to an\nindividual, perhaps Isaiah himself, King Cyrus, King Hezekiah,\nJosiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Moses, Job, or even some anonymous\ncontemporaries of Isaiah as the one spoken of by the prophet. Because\nthis chapter has caused \u201carguments and great confusion\u201d the\nrabbis decided that the simplest thing would be to stop reading it in\nsynagogues. So it is now banned in a lot of synagogues and many Jews\nwill not read it. Recently Isaiah 53 was read to some individual\nJewish people in the streets in Israel, they were all asked, \u2018who\nthe passage was speaking about?\u2019 They all replied, \u2018Jesus.\u2019   </strong></p><p><strong>So\nwhat we want to do is to look at these five stanzas and in doing so\nwe are brought to the foot of the cross.</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nThank you for allowing me to come to the cross </strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 1</p>",

He bore the sins of many and\ninterceded for rebels.</strong></p><p><strong>Stanza\n</strong></p><p><strong>1\nLook at My servant Isaiah 52:13-15</strong></p><p><strong>The\nfirst Stanza starts with the words see or behold my servant. This is\nGod speaking here, and he is saying something like this. \u2018Stop\neverything, set everything down and take a long enquiring look at my\nservant, see the Jesus you have never known.\u2019 </strong></p><p><strong>(Sometimes\nwe think we have Jesus sussed, we reduce or change him so he will fit\nneatly into our sterile theological categories. When </strong><strong>was\nthe last time we </strong><strong>learned\nsomething new about Jesus? As disciples we have been called to a life\nlong journey of discovering and rediscovering who Jesus really is.)</strong></p><p><strong>God\nsays for us to look, see, behold my servant shall prosper.\u2019 The\nword prosper is the Hebrew work \u2018sakal\u2019 This word can be\ntranslated prosper, or succeed or to act wisely; the word means\nprimarily to act wisely, to show prudence, good sense, insight and\nunderstanding. The natural fruit expected from acting wisely is that\nthis leads to prosperity or success. For this servant, wisdom was\nsubmitting himself to the will of God, irrespective of the cost or\nthe suffering. You could say that Isaiah 53 is a description of the\nwisest person who has ever lived. It is a revelation of a life lived\nin wisdom. </strong></p><p><strong>Wisdom\nis the understanding and acceptance that suffering may or probably\nwill be a necessity in order for me to accomplish God\u2019s will for my\nlife.</strong></p><p><strong>The\nverses go on to say:-</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>He\nshall be exalted and lifted up and shall be very high.  Just as there\nwere many who were astonished at him\u2014so marred was his appearance,\nbeyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of mortals\u2014so he\nshall startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of\nhim, for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that\nwhich they had not heard they shall contemplate.\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>There\nis a lot in these verses,  but let me mention one thing, when it\ncomes to understanding people, often we equate their status with\ntheir appearance. When we are told that many were astonished at him,\nthe idea behind the word is horrified. The Greek translation of the\nOld Testament uses the word adoxeo for the word marred. Which\nliterally means \"without glory,\" and conveys the idea of\nbeing held in no esteem, of being of ill repute or even of being\ndespicable! It can mean to hold one in contempt. It suggests that the\nJewish crowd were appalled at Him and held Him in contempt, but as\nfar as God is concerned he shall be exalted and lifted up and shall\nbe very high.</strong></p><p><strong>To\nbe like Jesus is to live in such away that your are more conscious as\nto how God the Father sees you, than how others see you. It is very\ninteresting that Isaiah speaks about the servant of the Lord having\nhis face/appearance marred. The face is the most specific indicator\nof a persons identity. I understand that we will never, or could ever\nsuffer the way Jesus had to. But often the way others treat us can\nmar our identity, the unkind things they say to us or about us can\nrob us of accepting who we are.</strong></p><p><strong>It\nis a terrifying thought to recognise that Satan was thrown out of\nheaven because he found his value, significance and worth on his\nappearance. The bible says:-</strong></p><p>\u2018<strong>Therefore\nI cast you as a profane thing<br/>\nOut of the mountain of God;<br/>\nAnd\nI destroyed you, O covering cherub,<br/>\nFrom the midst of the fiery\nstones.<br/>\n\"Your heart was lifted up because of your\nbeauty;<br/>\nYou corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your\nsplendour;\u2019 Ezekiel 28:17</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that to suffer in your will is wisdom.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 2 Peter 3 1JJohn 1:1-3:12</p>",

He bore the sins of many and\ninterceded for rebels.</strong></p><p><strong>Stanza\n2 The rejection of my servant. Isaiah 53:1-3</strong></p><p><strong>Isaiah\n53:1-3 are very painful and disturbing verses. Look at some of the\nlanguage Isaiah uses. He had no </strong><u><strong>beauty</strong></u><strong>\nor </strong><u><strong>majesty\nto attract</strong></u><strong>\nus to him,</strong><u><strong>\nnothing in his appearance that we should desire him.</strong></u><strong>\nHe was </strong><u><strong>despised</strong></u><strong>\nand </strong><u><strong>rejected</strong></u><strong>\nby mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.</strong><u><strong>\n</strong></u><u><strong>Like\none from whom people hide their faces,</strong></u><strong>\nhe was </strong><u><strong>despised</strong></u><strong>,\nand </strong><u><strong>we\nheld him in low esteem. </strong></u></p><p><strong>The\nidea behind despised </strong><strong>is\nfrom a root meaning to accord little worth to something means to\ndisdain or to hold in contempt. The Hebrew word Bazah is used in a\nnumber of places to mean \u201cdespise\u201d in the sense of treating\nsomeone or something as totally insignificant or worthless. I</strong><strong>t\nis an emotional response which ranges from strong dislike to\nloathing!</strong></p><p><strong>He\nwas rejected. The idea here in Isa 53:3</strong><strong>\n</strong><strong>is\nbeing abandoned by others. The word rejected, The Hebrew word </strong><strong><strong>hadel,\n</strong></strong><strong>carries\nwith it the idea of ceasing or desisting from something or leaving\nsomething before it reaches its end or conclusion. What Isaiah is\nsaying is that when Jesus Christ came into the world, there would be\nmany who would seem to have somewhat of an interest in Him for a\nwhile, but their interest was transient (and for what they could get\nout of it for themselves, as in </strong><a href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%206.66\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Jn\n6:66</strong></a><strong>)\nand they would all eventually leave Him and abandon Him before He\ncompleted His assignment. </strong></p><p><strong>Why\nwas he despised and rejected?  Because he did not comply with their\nexpectations. He did not fit into their categories, he was not\nimpressive, he was not \u2018</strong><strong>Super</strong><strong>man\u2019,\n</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>r\n\u2018</strong><strong>Iron\nman</strong><strong>,\u2019\nor some other character from a movie, he was a servant. They saw him\nas a sapling, that is what the Hebrew means for tender plant. They\nwere looking for a Messiah that was more like an oak tree, strong and\nimpressive. </strong></p><p><strong>Can\nyou imagine the depth of sorrow and grief Jesus must have felt? The\npain of rejection is one of the most difficult kinds of pain to cope\nwith. Some scientific studies have shown that the emotional pain of\nrejection can be worse than physical pain and our memories find it\neasier to relive an emotional trauma, making it harder to deal with.\nJesus refused to allow the need for approval and acceptance, to\ndivert him from the purposes of His Father. He would rather live in\nthe pain of the will of God than fall into to trap of needing to\nprove himself into an attempt to ease the pain of rejection. Back in\nJohn 6 the people said to Jesus, \u2019So they asked him, \u201cWhat sign\nthen will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you\ndo? \u2018 John 6:66. In other words, prove yourself, impress us, earn\nour acceptance!</strong></p><p><strong>Father\nthank you that Jesus choose sorrow for us.</strong></p><p><strong>Bible in a year:</strong> 1 John 3:13-5:21 2 John 3 John Jude 1:1-16</p>",

Could it be that his silence was an expression of\nhim concentrating on entrusting and obeying God? Could it be that in\nthe midst of this messy, cruel experience, Jesus\u2019 focus was to keep\ntrusting? We don\u2019t know.

      "It is very disturbing how this story has been used over the years. The traditional understanding is that Jesus is using the story of this poor widow as an example and encouragement of sacrificial living. This misuse of this story has deflected people from Jesus\u2019 original intent. It is true that Jesus is using this widow as an example, but not the kind of example we may think. This widow is an example of someone who was being spiritually abused by a religious system."
